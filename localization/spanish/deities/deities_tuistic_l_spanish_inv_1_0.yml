 omen_thunraz_desc:3 "Donar, un dios que blandía un martillo y que estaba asociado con el rayo, el trueno, las tormentas, las arboledas y los árboles sagrados, la fuerza, la protección de la humanidad y también con la santificación y la fertilidad, era un dios germánico de gran importancia para los vikingos nórdicos que siglos más tarde sería conocido por los Nórdicos Vikingos como Thor.\n\nHistóricamente, los primeros registros de los pueblos Germánicos fueron realizados por los Romanos, y en estos trabajos Donar/Thor es frecuentemente referido - a través de un proceso conocido como interpretatio romana (donde las características percibidas como similares por los Romanos resultan en la identificación de un dios no Romano como una deidad Romana) - como el dios Greco-Romano Hércules.\n\nDonar/Thor es un dios muy mencionado a lo largo de la historia escrita de los pueblos Germánicos, desde la ocupación Romana de las regiones de Germania, pasando por las expansiones Germánicas del Período Migratorio, hasta su gran popularidad durante la Era Vikinga."

 deity_tiwaz:0 "$omen_tiwaz$"
 omen_tiwaz:1 "Tiwaz"
 omen_tiwaz_desc:3 "Tiwaz, an early incarnation/name of what would later be the Norse God Tyr (Tiwaz being the Proto-Germanic origin name for Tyr, according to the Etymology), was a Germanic war god of significant importance. In Norse mythology, from which most surviving narratives about gods among the Germanic peoples stem, Tiwaz/Tyr sacrifices his hand to the monstrous wolf Fenrir, who bites off his limb while the gods bind the animal, and he is foretold of being consumed by the similarly monstrous dog Garmr during the events of Ragnarök. /n/n While Týr's etymological heritage reaches back to the Proto-Indo-European period, very few direct references to the god survive prior to the Old Norse period. Like many other non-Roman deities, Týr receives mention in Latin texts by way of the process of interpretatio romana, in which Latin texts refer to the god by way of a perceived counterpart in Roman mythology. Latin inscriptions and texts frequently refer to Týr as Mars."

 deity_wodanaz:0 "$omen_wodanaz$"
 omen_wodanaz:1 "Wodanaz"
 omen_wodanaz_desc:3 "An early incarnation of the Norse God Odín, Wodanaz (Wodanaz being the Proto-Germanic origin name for Odín, according to the Etymology) was a widely revered god in Germanic mythology. Norse mythology, the source of most surviving information about him, associates Odín/Wodanaz with wisdom, healing, death, royalty, the gallows, knowledge, war, battle, victory, sorcery, poetry, frenzy, and the runic alphabet, and projects him as the husband of the goddess Frigg. \n\nThe earliest records of the Germanic peoples were recorded by the Romans, and in these works Odín is frequently referred to—via a process known as interpretatio romana (where characteristics perceived to be similar by Romans result in identification of a non-Roman god as a Roman deity)—as the Roman god Mercury. \n\nThe first clear example of this occurs in the Roman historian Tacitus's late 1st-century work Germania, where, writing about the religion of the Suebi (a confederation of Germanic peoples), he comments that 'among the gods Mercury is the one they principally worship. They regard it as a religious duty to offer to him, on fixed days, human as well as other sacrificial victims.'"

 deity_frawjon:0 "$omen_frawjon$"
 omen_frawjon:1 "Frawjon"
 omen_frawjon_desc:3 "A Germanic goddess associated with love, beauty, fertility, sex, war, gold, and seiðr, Frawjon, was known to the Norse as Freya (Frawjon being the Proto-Germanic origin name for Freya, according to the Etymology), which is the source of most surviving information about her. Frawjon/Freya rules over her heavenly field, Fólkvangr, where she receives half of those who die in battle, the other half going to the god Odín's hall, Valhalla. \n\nEarly possible historical mention of her exists from the Romans interactions with the Germanic peoples by way of the process of interpretatio romana, in which Latin texts refer to the god by way of a perceived counterpart in Roman mythology, comparing her to the Goddess Isis, although it should be noted that this historical mention may in fact refer to the goddess Frijjo, known later to the Norse as Frigg. \n\nScholars in fact have debated whether Frawjon/Freyja and the goddess Frijjo/Frigg ultimately stem from a single goddess common among the Germanic peoples, although this is only theory."

 deity_halja:0 "$omen_halja$"
 omen_halja:1 "Halja"
 omen_halja_desc:3 "Halja, known later to the Norse as Hel (Halja being the Proto-Germanic origin name for Hel, according to the Etymology), was a Germanic (and later Norse) Goddess of Death and ruler of Halja/Hel, which shares her name. While the only surviving historical information derives from her later Norse incarnation of Hel, there is possible early evidence of her dating back to the Roman Era centuries before. \n\nIt has been suggested that several imitation medallions and bracteates of the Germanic Migration Period (ca. first centuries AD) feature depictions of Halja/Hel. In particular the bracteates IK 14 and IK 124 depict a rider traveling down a slope and coming upon a female being holding a scepter or a staff. The downward slope may indicate that the rider is traveling towards the realm of the dead and the woman with the scepter may be a female ruler of that realm, corresponding to Halja/Hel."

 deity_luk:0 "$omen_luk$"
 omen_luk:1 "Luk"
 omen_luk_desc:3 "A very possible early incarnation of the Norse God Loki, the Germanic god Luk (although the etymology of the name Loki has been extensively debated, it is believed its origin is in the Germanic root Luk) a god whose origins and role in mythology have been fiercely debated by scholars, some of whom have described him as that of a trickster god, while others have theorized, he may have served as a god of the Hearth/Fire, similar to the Greek Goddess Hestia. \n\nWhile little solid evidence of his early Germanic existence has been found during this period in history like with other Norse gods, it is believed by some scholars that he likely may have existed by this point, due to his later importance in Norse Mythology."

 deity_baloraz:0 "$omen_baloraz$"
 omen_baloraz:1 "Baloraz"
 omen_baloraz_desc:3 "A god in Germanic mythology, Baloraz was an early incarnation of the Norse god Baldr, (Baloraz being the Proto-Germanic origin name for Baldr, according to the Etymology) who was the son of Odín/Wodanaz and Frigg/Frijjo, and is the god of light, joy, purity, and the summer sun. In later Norse myth, the death of Baldr as both a great tragedy to the Æsir and a harbinger of Ragnarök. \n\nHe has sometimes been compared with the Greco-Roman Apollo, for whom similar characteristics exist. \n\nWhile little solid evidence of his early Germanic existence has been found during this period in history like with other Norse gods, it is believed by some scholars that he likely may have existed by this point, due to his later importance in Norse Mythology."

 omen_vindler:1 "Vindler"
 omen_vindler_desc:3 "A Germanic/Scandinavian god of notable importance, Vindler or as he is more commonly referred in Norse mythology, Heimdal (while the etymology of Heimdal's name is obscure, one of possible names he was attested to having was Vindler). \n\nWhile much knowledge of the god in question has been lost, evidently due to the memory of Heimdal/Vindler having faded by the time the extant sources were composed (possibly indicating that he may in fact been older than the other Norse-Germanic gods), it is known that in Norse myth, he was the god who kept watch for invaders and the onset of Ragnarök from his dwelling Himinbjörg, where the burning rainbow bridge Bifröst meets the sky. He is attested as possessing foreknowledge and keen senses, particularly eyesight and hearing. "
