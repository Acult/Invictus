 zorgo_event.1.t:0 "Settling Old Scores"
 zorgo_event.1.desc:0 "[SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], there is a delicate matter that will require your personal attention. We have heard reports that [SCOPE.sCharacter('random_dude').GetName] has been threatening to kill [SCOPE.sCharacter('random_dude_2').GetName] over real estate; it seems that they both want the same property in [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] and neither is backing down. The war of words has continued to escalate over the last few weeks, and just last night, [SCOPE.sCharacter('random_dude_2').GetFirstName] was attacked outside of [SCOPE.sCharacter('random_dude_2').GetHerHis] home and was badly beaten, ultimately losing an eye.\n\nWhile we normally wouldn't trouble you with such things, your blood relation with [SCOPE.sCharacter('random_dude').GetFirstName] complicates the issue - [SCOPE.sCharacter('random_dude_2').GetFirstName] has been telling everyone that you sent your henchmen over there to teach [SCOPE.sCharacter('random_dude_2').GetHerHim] a lesson, and people are starting to listen."
 zorgo_event.1.a:0 "Send [SCOPE.sCharacter('random_dude_2').GetFirstName] a gift from the treasury and our profuse apologies"
 zorgo_event.1.b:0 "Tell that fool to keep their mouth shut if they'd like to keep the other one!"
 
 zorgo_event.2.t:0 "A Curious Discovery"
 zorgo_event.2.desc:0 "[SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], a farmer was working in the fields near [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] when a weird abberation was unearthed; a silver idol of some rustic, long-forgotten god, covered in strange runes that are indecipherable. [SCOPE.sCharacter('priest').GetName], who is an expert in such matters, has said a malevolent spirit is trapped inside the statuette and that we have unwittingly unleashed a curse. While [SCOPE.sCharacter('priest').GetFirstName] has said this is a terrible omen for our people, not everyone is convinced that this is a stroke of bad luck."
 zorgo_event.2.a:0 "Melt the statue down and make coins - I am not afraid of some ancient spirit"
 zorgo_event.2.b:0 "Tell [SCOPE.sCharacter('priest').GetFirstName] to rebury it in the same spot and to offer sacrifices"

 zorgo_event.3.t:0 "A Gift From The Sea"
 zorgo_event.3.desc:0 "[SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] was fast asleep in [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] bedchambers when, all of a sudden, there were loud screams and the sounds of breaking furniture, ripping [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] from [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] reverie. There was a flash of steel, and a few frantic moments later, [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName]'s bodyguards were holding [SCOPE.sCharacter('dumbass').GetName] on the ground.\n\nWhat came next was a story so ridiculous, so strange, that for a moment, [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] thought that [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetSheHe] was still dreaming. But no, this actually happened; it appears that [SCOPE.sCharacter('dumbass').GetFirstName], clearly a simpleton, had purchased a gigantic tuna in the fish market and had brought it to [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] as a present. How he managed to sneak past your sentries in the middle of the night remains a mystery.\n\nWhen pressed for more details, [SCOPE.sCharacter('dumbass').GetFirstName] keeps sobbing the same story - 'It's the biggest fish I've ever seen, [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName], and I just had to give it to you. I didn't mean any harm, honest'. In fairness, next to [SCOPE.sCharacter('dumbass').GetHerHis] feet is truly the largest tuna you have ever seen."
 zorgo_event.3.a:0 "Um...thanks, I guess? Here, take some gold for your troubles"
 zorgo_event.3.b:0 "Guards, beat this idiot with the tuna and throw them both in the street!"
 zorgo_event.3.c:0 "That was the dumbest thing you've ever done, [SCOPE.sCharacter('dumbass').GetFirstName]."

 zorgo_event.4.t:0 "Observing the Master"
 zorgo_event.4.desc:0 "Lately, [SCOPE.sCharacter('heir').GetName] has been pestering [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] almost daily with a simple request, one that [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] cannot ignore for much longer. What [SCOPE.sCharacter('heir').GetFirstName] has asked for is simple enough, if a little embarrassing; all that [SCOPE.sCharacter('heir').GetSheHe] wants is the chance to observe [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] during the next Council meeting. Being somewhat inexperienced with political matters, [SCOPE.sCharacter('heir').GetFirstName] would like to watch 'the master at work', so to speak, in hopes of learning how to deal with advisors."
 zorgo_event.4.a:0 "You can sit behind me, but keep quiet and don't appear too eager"
 zorgo_event.4.b:0 "You will have plenty of time to learn on your own one day - leave me alone"

 zorgo_event.5.t:0 "Overflowing Granaries"
 zorgo_event.5.desc:0 "[SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], the harvests were so plentiful this year that we have run out of room to store the wheat. The granaries that we have built near [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] are packed to bursting, and there is simply no room left for what we have on hand - we will just have to sell the excess at market."
 zorgo_event.5.a:0 "We are glad that we are not wanting for food - the people should rejoice!"

 zorgo_event.6.t:0 "Tax Collector Murdered"
 zorgo_event.6.desc:0 "[SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], we are sorry to inform you that one of our tax collectors, a man named [SCOPE.sCharacter('taxman').GetName], was found stabbed to death in the streets of [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName]. Everyone claims that [SCOPE.sCharacter('taxman').GetFirstName] was known to have 'sticky fingers' and skimmed much more off of the top for himself than he should have, and while this might be true, was the man deserving of such a violent death? Now, the locals are refusing to tell us who was responsible for the crime, even though our soldiers have been threatening them if they don't speak...this does not bode well."
 zorgo_event.6.a:0 "This is terribly vexing to hear...farewell, [SCOPE.sCharacter('taxman').GetFirstName]"

 zorgo_event.7.t:0 "Barbarian Raid"
 zorgo_event.7.desc:0 "We have terrible news to report this morning, o [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName]. A band of barbarian raiders has been pillaging the region of [temple_province.GetName], crossing the river in the middle of the night and catching our guards unawares. Not only have the bandits managed to steal a bit of gold, which is bad, but they killed some locals, which is worse - our people mourn their lost lives and property today."
 zorgo_event.7.a:0 "We will do everything within our power to punish those responsible!"

 zorgo_event.8.t:0 "A Song for [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName]"
 zorgo_event.8.desc:0 "A few days ago, two famed troubadors that are known for singing in unison, [SCOPE.sCharacter('bard').GetName] and [SCOPE.sCharacter('bard_2').GetName], arrived in [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] and requested an audience with [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] whenever [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetSheHe] has the time. The reason for the visit was known even before they arrived in our capital, for the reputation of [SCOPE.sCharacter('bard').GetFirstName] and [SCOPE.sCharacter('bard_2').GetFirstName] certainly precedes them, and their latest masterwork, an epic poem entitled 'The Mighty Deeds of [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName]', has been the talk of the town for weeks.\n\nThe two poets have humbly asked for the chance to perform, and later on this evening, [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] shall have the honor of hearing the famous piece recited in person."
 zorgo_event.8.a:0 "At least the subject matter will be interesting..."

 zorgo_event.9.t:0 "An Uncovered Plot"
 zorgo_event.9.desc:0 "At the last moment, our agents uncovered a plot to have [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] assassinated, and as more and more details are revealed, the scandal continues to grow, shocking the inhabitants of [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName].\n\nThe rot runs deep; it seems that the perpetrators were able to persuade one of [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName]'s relatives, [SCOPE.sCharacter('cousin').GetName], to join their number. Indeed, [SCOPE.sCharacter('cousin').GetFirstName] was the lynchpin of the entire operation, for it was hoped that [SCOPE.sCharacter('cousin').GetSheHe] would have been able to bring [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] someplace secluded where the murderers would have been hiding. In fact, [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] was supposed to pay a visit tomorrow afternoon... \n\nWhen the intrigue was discovered, [SCOPE.sCharacter('cousin').GetFirstName] tried to flee in the middle of the night, hoping to find a ship to take [SCOPE.sCharacter('cousin').GetHerHim] anywhere, but was arrested at the harbor. What shall we do?"
 zorgo_event.9.a:0 "Throw [SCOPE.sCharacter('cousin').GetFirstName] into the deepest pit...for now"

 zorgo_event.10.t:0 "The Wandering Merchant"
 zorgo_event.10.desc:0 "A few days ago, a foreigner named [SCOPE.sCharacter('euthymios').GetName] was apprehended on the outskirts of [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] and brought before [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], where it was demanded that the stranger explain himself. In a former life, [SCOPE.sCharacter('euthymios').GetFirstName] was a merchant, hailing from the city of [GetProvince('(int32)416').GetName], but political upheaval in his hometown resulted in his banishment. After wandering for years, Euthymios has finally reached our lands, destitute and weary.\n\nOnce he is standing before [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName], Euthymios extends a tiny coinpurse and falls to his knees. 'Please, gracious one, accept all that I have left in this life, but allow me to stay here with you. I can't go on any further'.\n\n[SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] is inclined to show mercy, but there will undoubtedly be complaints amongst the locals, who have no desire to live with the exiled trader in their midst."
 zorgo_event.10.a:0 "Our hospitality to the stranger is well-known; you may stay with us"
 zorgo_event.10.b:0 "Tell this fool to leave our city at once! What a preposterous thought"
