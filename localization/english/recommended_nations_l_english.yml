 bactria_start: "#t Bactria#!\nDifficulty: #y Hard#!\n\nBactria remains under the iron grip of the Seleukid Empire, which has become pre-occupied with numerous conflicts to the West, leaving its satrapy undefended from the hordes of Scythia. Bactria is wealthy, urbanized and fertile, and could become a great nation, if she can win her freedom."
 scythia_start: "#t Scythia#!\nDifficulty: #y Easy#!\n\nScythia has been in great decline after king Ateas died at the hands of Philip II of Macedon. Despite shaky relations with the Greeks, some start to view their cities as pillars of strength and stability. Will Scythia change with the times or remain true to her nomadic way of life?"
 kush_start: "#t Kush#!\nDifficulty: #y Easy#!\n\nThe people of Kush have all but faded into obscurity after the fall of the 25th dynasty. It is time to reverse the fortunes and grow to become the strongest Pharaoh the world has ever seen!"
 judea_start: "#t Judea#!\nDifficulty: #y Hard#!\n\nFor centuries the Jews have been confined to Palestine and some corners of Arabia, their holy places and ancestral burial sites in the hands of usurpers. It is time to take back what belongs rightfully to the Hebrew people!"
 chola_start: "#t Chola#!\nDifficulty: #y Normal#!\n\nThe Tamil Kings of Chola, Chera, and Pandya dominated the south of India during Maurya rule. Unstable and prone to warfare, the triumvirate has divided the Tamil people for too long. By uniting them under one rule, we shall take our place as the rightful rulers of Tamilakam."
 #New (should translate when written)

 cyrenaica_start: "#t Cyrenaica#!\nDifficulty: #y Hard#!\n\nCyrenaica has long been the plaything of other empires; first the Achaemenids placed their hateful yoke of slavery upon them, and then the barbarous armies of Alexandros brought more chaos and forced servitude to this fertile and lush part of Africa. Cyrenaica, once home to a free and proud people, is now nominally ruled by Ptolemaios, the Macedonian general who seized power and established himself as Basileus."
 rhodes_start: "#t Rhodes#!\nDifficulty: #y Hard#!\n\nThe beautiful island of Rhodes is the gateway to the Aegean, strategically situated and blessed with an industrious and fine people, and it is these indisputable facts that have caused many foreign powers to covet the island for themselves. Rhodes was recently under siege for a year and is still recovering from the deleterious effects, but will not be broken!"

 #karmo_start: "#t Karmoia#!\nDifficulty: #y Easy#!\n\nKarmo has risen as one of the mightiest states of Turdetania. Important cities like Astigi and Urso declared vassalage when the Karmoan army showed around their walls. But this success has lead the rest of the Turdetanian states to look at Karmo as a possible threat to their independence."
 #hasta_start: "#t Hastaia#!\nDifficulty: #y Normal#!\n\nThe city of Hasta lies in an excellent position. At the mouth of the Lacus Ligustinus and near the Punic city of Gadir, Hasta has grown as one of the biggest Turdetanian cities. Their relations with Gadir have involved a major acceptation and assimilation of Phoenician culture."
 #chersonesus_start: "#t Chersonesus#!\nDifficulty: #y Normal#!\n\nChersonesus is a Greek colony, but the lands around it in all directions are Tauri, inhabited by those Scythian-like men and women who play piracy upon Greek merchants sailing from Kalos Limen. These are resourceful and unforgiving people."
