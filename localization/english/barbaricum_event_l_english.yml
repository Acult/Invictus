 flavor_germanics.1.t:0 "The Great Flood"
 flavor_germanics.1.desc:"Days of rain and thunderstorms made our people in [SCOPE.ger_1_target.GetName] fear that the end of days is upon us. However these didn't herald the end but a large flood that swallowed houses, animals and humans alike - all never destined to see the light of days again.\n\nAfter it was over, the survivors praised the gods but are now posed with the great challenge to rebuild what was once. The land still gets flooded twice a day, creating thousands of small islands completely surrounded by water, but the water is slowly receding...\n\nOur people are looking for us to set aside some of our funds to try and help those in need, to make the best out of the situation."

 flavor_germanics.2.desc:0 "The recent population boost has led to higher demand of habitable land. Some of our men have brought up to imitate the Frisian terp settlements, which they erected several centuries ago. Amsivaria's shore seems like a good place to pile up mud to create terps and build houses on top of these to protect them from the floods. We would need to send some of our men to help them, however."

 flavor_germanics.4.desc:0 "After the death of [SCOPE.sChar('rip_dead_dog').GetName], people have tried to comfort me, but I never felt that they truly understood. Now I tend to avoid them and their idle chatter. However, there is one soul whose company I have not loathed: a brown dog who has participated in the excarnation ritual of [SCOPE.sChar('rip_dead_dog').GetName]'s body and shows similar behavior. Maybe the priest counseled me correctly and our loved ones truly live on in the dogs after an appropriate ceremony."

 flavor_germanics.6.t:0 "The Sacred Grove of Mannus"
 flavor_germanics.6.desc:0 "Once again it is time, the sacrifice to Mannus will happen tonight. As always we are fettered, showing our submission to our great God. Luckily, no one fell down this time - a good omen. Last year the son of the shaman had to roll himself out on the floor, after he fell down. The past year brought us many storms and the harvest was bad. This was surely caused by the clumsy youth! \n\nThis year's sacrifice stands proud in the middle of the sacred ground, bound to the old oak behind him. His features are barely recognisable, for the sun's last rays of the day blind me, Mannus' will hiding him from my sight. Already the Shaman approaches the victim, pressing the knife's edge to his chest, provoking the first droplets of blood to drop on the oak sapling beneath him. Heis lifeblood will renew the forests and earth. To safeguard our communities and better our harvests, he is offered to Mannus. Now, the blade is piercing his heart, his last breath cursing us, yet igniting the fire of life. \n\nAlready, the birds have begun to sing and rejoice, filling the void left by the sacrifices's death."
