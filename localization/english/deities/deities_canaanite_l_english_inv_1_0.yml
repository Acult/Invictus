 omen_taautus_desc:0 "Recorded by the Phoenician writer Sanchuniathon as Taautus, Ta'ut is the god that invented the letters and the first that began the writing of records, so he is the creator of History itself. Thanks to him we know how to administrate our resources and develop our society. Son of the god Mishor, some say he was from Byblos, although he has as home the lands of Egypt.\n\nThis deity is often associated with the Egyptian Thoth and the Greeks refer to him as their Hermes."

 omen_rasap_melqart_desc:0 "Rasap-Melqart, or Rasef-Melkart, was a syncretic god who we know very little about. The gods constituent parts are Rasap and Melqart. While Melqart was a popular god in Tyre, Rasap was a god of Sidon. An archaeological site in Ibiza gives us a precious punic double tablet which reads: 'To the brd, to Resef-Melkart, this sanctuary dedicated by 's'dr, son of Ya'as ay, son of brgd, son of Eshmunhilles,' calling what was quite possibly the island's patron deity: Rasap-Melqart. Despite being a relatively obscure deity, Rasap-Melqart played an important role in the cultural and religious life of Ibiza. His temple was an important gathering place for locals and visitors alike, and his worship helped to reinforce the island's identity as a center of maritime trade and commerce in the ancient world."
