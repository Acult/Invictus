 omen_zichos_desc:0 "Zichosa is a reconstructed Thracian word to represent the Snake-Legged Goddess of the Thracians. The Thracians worshipped this Snake-Legged Goddess but left no remains to her true name. She was likely a goddess inherited from the Scythians who too had such a goddess. Zichosa is often depicted as a tall woman with snake-like tendrils."

The Greeks described her as a 'strange' goddess. Some identify her with Ares and derive her name as meaning 'ablaze,' which could also relate her to Hephaestus."

 omen_kotyto_desc:0 "Kotytia, also known as Cotytia and Kotyto, was a goddess of sex and was associated with orgasmic rituals. In fact, she may have came from a celebration of the rape of Persephone, celebrated by the Edoni Thracians, before spreading to the Greeks. In fact, it became widespread enough to where the phrase 'Companion of Kotyttia' became synonymous with 'slut.'"

 omen_zis:0 "Zis"
 omen_zis_desc:0 "Zis was the son of Bendis and possibly the Dacian version of sky-god present in many Indo-European people's pantheons. Zis was equated with many, many foreign gods (Dionysus, Hermes, Apollo, Ares), possibly indicating that Zis was an ancient god of the people, and thus simple enough to relate to any new god. In fact, it is likely that Zis was the universal god amongst the Thracian and Dacian peoples. He was also known as a god of many faces (usually three), and a horseman god."
