In fact, Nusku was also a god of agriculture and growth, and it is likely that the variation of Nusku that would come to be known to the Jews as Nisroch was a cheif god of agriculture, perhaps why he would earn the epithet in Christian religion as 'Chief Cook of Hell.'\n\nIn more traditionl Chaldean mythos, Nusku was a protective deity against demons, and was known to be the sukkal, or divine vizier, of Enlil. Some sources even claim that he was a son of Enlil."
