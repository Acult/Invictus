Following this, the goddesses tried to win bribe Paris to choose them.\n\nHera offered political power; Athena promised infinite wisdom; and Aphrodite tempted him with the most beautiful woman in the world: Helen, wife of Menelaus of Sparta.\n\nWhile Greek culture placed a greater emphasis on prowess and power, Paris chose to award the apple to Aphrodite, thereby dooming his city, which was destroyed in the war that ensued."

Next they ventured to Cyzicus, where they would run into a surprise attack from the earthborn giants called Gegeines. Then, Iason and the Argonauts set sail towards the court of Phineus where they were attacked by harpies. Finally, in order to reach Colchis, they sailed through the treacherous Symplegades, which were crushing and clashing cliffs that targetted anything traveling through them. Finally, they arrived at Colchis where they would have to face against Aeëtes and his impossible trials to be granted the Golden Fleece."

Out of pity, the gods transformed the two into gods of the sea. Ino became Leukothea and her son became Palaemon.\n\nIn a version of the myth from Rhodes regards Halia, a nymph (or minor goddess). She was the daughter of the titans Thalassa and Pontus. Halia would become the wife of Poseidon and the union birthed the pair six sons as well as the goddess Rhodos. However, the sons denied Aphrodite to land on their island, and so she cursed the sons who would sexually assault their own mother, Halia.

She would create Ouranos, the heavens, before bringing forth more children. Ourea, the mountains; Pontos, the sea; and the Cyclopes; all without aid of a consort. Ouranos would become her first consort. From this union, Ge grew pregnant with three boys. However, Ouranos, in fear of his position, refused to allow the children to be born. Thus, Ge would suffer immensely as Ouranos would prevent her from giving birth. Finally, Kronos would help her get revenge on Ouranos by cutting off his male member. From this many beings were born: Erinys, the giants, Nymphs of the Ash tree (Meliae), and from the majority of the flesh arose the goddess Aphrodite. Finally, the children within Ge were born as the Titans Briareos, Kottos, and Gyes."
