 tribal_duel_2_desc_loser:0 "When the tribal elders gather together on sacred days to remember our ancestors, those brave men and women who fought and gave their lives to make our people what they are today, another esteemed name shall by added to the list of heroes; your own. Although you fought to the best of your ability, it was not enough to triumph over your enemy, but there is no shame in dying in glorious combat." 

 tribal_duel_2_desc_axe_killer:0 "[target.GetName] launches one final, desperate attack, with each wild swing meeting nothing but air. This is the best that they can do? And they thought themselves able to stand against you in combat...you are filled with pity for a brief moment, but soon an icy contempt overtakes you, and you do the business that must be done. With a powerful blow, you bury your axe deep in [target.GetName]'s skull, cleaving it in twain."
 tribal_duel_2_desc_spear_killer:0 "The air is filled with a terrible cracking of wood as [target.GetName]'s weapon is shattered, unable to withstand the fierce torrent of blows you unleashed upon it. Your opponent, realizing the end is near, begins to cry out, filling the air with a hoarse wailing that raises the hair on your arms. Falling forward, you plunge your spear deep into [target.GetName]'s throat, ending their life alongside their pitiful mewling."
 tribal_duel_2_desc_horse_killer:0 "You and [target.GetName] are struggling arm in arm at this point, despite both of you being on horseback; all weapons have been lost in the melee, lost in moments of primal rage, with only the overwhelming desire to kill the other remaining. It is more than combat between man and beast at this moment...it is a battle of wills. [target.GetName] moves their hands from your throat, trying to reach a hidden dagger, and you see an opportunity; leaping from your mount, you tackle your opponent to the ground. You don't exactly remember what happened next, but soon you were being hoisted into the air by the men of your tribe, and [target.GetName]'s lifeless body lay still on the ground."
 tribal_duel_2_desc_hands_killer:0 "You jerk your head to the side, letting [target.GetName]'s fist whizz past your face, and you punch them back - hard. Following this with a punch to the stomach, you knock the wind out of them, sending [target.GetName] staggering back, but what is this! It appears that they are too weak to get up. Kneeling down in [target.GetName]'s face, you grab their swollen face with both hands, telling them that they fought honorably, and not to fear what comes next. There is a twist and a snap, and you drop the lifeless body to the ground. When word spreads that you have slain your opponent with your bare hands, men will greatly fear you."
 tribal_duel_2_desc_sword_killer:0 "From your earliest years, you have killed men with swords; the first, a cocky Roman mercenary with a small, double-edged blade he said came from Hispania, was when you had only seen fourteen years. You have led men into battle and have plundered the camps of your enemies, and you are unmatched in arms among any that live among your people. So it should come as no surprise that you have made quick work of [target.GetName], a whelp that should have never lifted a sword against your own."

 tribal_duel_2_desc_generic_killer:0 "And, just like that, it is over; your enemy lies dead at your feet."

##################################################################################
 tribal_duel_2_desc_1:0 "It is going to be a beautiful day, clearly. The breezes are gentle and the sun shines brightly in the sky, an impartial witness to the gathering crowds below. You are standing across from your opponent, axe in hand, waiting for an opportunity to strke. It is clear from the steely-eyed look on your enemy's face that you are in for a tough fight, but this is what you expected. Suddenly, there is a shout, and all conscious thought recedes, consumed by the primal urge to survive. You step forward and swing mightily, a battle cry bursting from your lips."
 tribal_duel_2_desc_2:0 "Leaping back, you barely dodge a wild swing - that one came so close that you could practically taste the whistling blade. Damp clumps of sweat-matted hair cling to your forehead, a distraction you overcome as you parry another blow. You have been grazed a few times and your head is pounding, but you aren't the only one suffering; your opponent is breathing heavily, with flecks of bloody foam covering their face - you are close, desperately close, to ending this. Turning to face you, teeth bared, your adversary screams and races towards you. Bracing yourself, you grip your axe with both hands and rush forward to meet the charge."
 tribal_duel_2_desc_3:0 "There is a deeply satisfying crunch as your axe cleaves through armor and flesh and bites into bone, and from the bloodcurdling scream that escapes their lips, you can tell that it hurts - badly. But there is no time to pause - your enemy somehow kicks you away, knocking you to the groud, and lifts their axe over their head with both hands, baring down on you with all of their remaining strength. It seems that they are going to try to end this now...the moment of truth is here."

 tribal_duel_2_desc_4:0 "You and your enemy circle each other warily, both gripping your spears, waiting for the other to make a move - or a mistake. Minutes go by without any tangible action; is this coward going to attack or what? You didn't come here to dance. You strike at his spear, testing his defenses, and decide that enough is enough. Feinting to your left, you shift your weight at the last minute and bear down on your combatant's right side; you are rewarded for this maneuver by drawing the first blood of the engagement."
 tribal_duel_2_desc_5:0 "Your spears are locked against each other, and your opponent is doing their best to try to disarm you. Falling to their knees, they thrusts upwards and you are forced to spin away wildly to avoid a spearpoint in your throat. Losing your balance, you stagger back, trying to repel the fierce assault, but your enemy presses forward, offering no quarter. A terrifying fear begins to overwhelm you; what if you actually lose this? Shouting at yourself as much as your enemy, you counterattack. You will not stumble!"
 tribal_duel_2_desc_6:0 "You thrust at your opponent's legs, forcing them back as you lunge forward. You are both getting tired, though, and neither of you are able to press the advantage; your opponent parries your counterattack easily, and still has enough fight left in them to curse you loudly. The battle has been evenly matched up until this moment, something that you have decided must change immediately. You block a wayward blow from your foe's weapon and press on the attack, but you miscalculate - there is a moment of blind panic as you see a spearpoint headed towards your face. Could this be the end?"

 tribal_duel_2_desc_7:0 "You charge towards your enemy, your horse's hooves drumming a steady tattoo in the ground. Your opponent grimly meets your attack, and as your mounts clash, there is an awful sound of clanging metal and screaming horse. Leaning forward, you strike decisively, carefully avoiding the wild swings lobbied towards you. Somehow, they manage to connect, and your horse receives a glancing blow, sending a stream of blood spurting onto the dusty ground. Gritting your teeth, you dig in and counterattack."
 tribal_duel_2_desc_8:0 "You somehow managed to avoid being hit in that last charge, but where are they?! You are spinning your horse around frantically, trying to gain your bearings, but your opponent is literally riding circles around you. It is clear that they are mocking you; they are yelling something, but you can't hear what is being said. Leaning forward on your mount, you bear down upon them, summoning forth every drop of wrath within you."
 tribal_duel_2_desc_9:0 "The fight is in its last desperate moments; both man and horse are exhausted to the point of collapse, creating a perilous situation for all involved. Your arm is aching, you are dizzy from the loss of blood, and your heartbeat is pounding in your ears. It requires all of the strength you have left to lift your arm, and it is poor consolation that your enemy is suffering as much as you are. As the two of you meet again, you are aware that this will be for the last time...someone is bound to slip up."

 tribal_duel_2_desc_10:0 "You and your enemy have been grappling fiercely, arms entangled as each tries to land a blow. Dodging a weak attempt at a headbutt, your fist connects squarely with your enemy's jaw, causing them to spit a bloody tooth on the ground moments later. Your opponent bellows like a wounded bull, stepping forward with both fists raised. You can see that their eye is starting to swell shut and it encourages you...you are winning this. Your opponent swings and you meet the attack head on, encouraged by your success so far, but second-guess yourself immediately as your field of vision explodes into stars; by the gods, that one hurt!"
 tribal_duel_2_desc_11:0 "A solid punch connects with your stomach and the wind is knocked out of you; falling to the ground, you wheeze hoarsely, lungs desperate for air. You barely catch your enemy's hands before they circle your throat, and the two of you wrestle on the ground, each struggling to achieve supremacy over the other. It is with tremendous effort that you are able to get your opponent off of you. Screaming angrily, you turn the tables by tackling them, and the two of you spill onto the ground. You will choke the life from this fool and feed their liver to the birds of the field!"
 tribal_duel_2_desc_12:0 "The fighting is getting more and more intense, and the both of you are starting to make mistakes. Your face is starting to swell and you can't see out of your left eye. But you are giving as good as you get, and you are not the only one struggling; thin rivulets of blood are pouring down your enemy's face, which is a patchwork of bruises and cuts. Sensing an opportunity, your opponent tries to overwhelm you with a barrage of attacks but fails to connect a single blow; a quick sidestep and you aim at their sides, connecting and causing them to grunt. "

 tribal_duel_2_desc_13:0 "The air is filled with the clanging of metal as blade strikes blade, and your opponent presses against you, trying to force you down onto your knees. With a powerful shove, you knock them backwards, regaining your footing and stepping forward to press your advantage. Your enemy's opening salvo was a brutal effort, one that came close to ending this fight before it really began, but now they seem to be recalculating their strategy. Breathing calmly, your enemy paces cautiously just out of arm's length. Your eyes lock as your swords meet again."
 tribal_duel_2_desc_14:0 "You let out a tiny cry as the tip of your enemy's sword pierces through your armor; your enemy's blade is slick with your blood. Sensing your momentary panic, they lean forward, hoping to follow up with a fatal blow, but you manage to parry them back, leaving a deep wound across their cheek as payment for their efforts. No one is unscathed in this match, but it is too close to tell who has the upper hand. Gritting your teeth, you ignore the throbbing wound in your side and attack again."
 tribal_duel_2_desc_15:0 "Spinning around gracefully, you redirect your opponent's sword away from your head and strike downward, knicking their arm and causing them to utter a loud oath. You continue to swing at them, a series of blows that knocks them off balance and sends them careening to the ground. Now! This is the moment you have been waiting for. You abandon your caution, seeking to press the advantage, and fall upon your foe. They lamely lift their sword, showing that they do not submit, and your arms clash."



 tribal_duel_2_desc_16:0 "The watching crowds are cheering, but for whom? Wiping the sweat off of your forehead, you try to concentrate. You can't tell who is gaining the upper hand. You have given a few good blows, but have taken a couple as well. Do the crowds see something that you don't? What is happening?!"
 tribal_duel_2_desc_17:0 "It is dreadfully silent outside of the small ring where the two of you are fighting. There is mostly a droning of flies, a buzzing undercurrent that is punctuated with the occasional scream, or the splattering sound of gore being released onto the earth. The sun, uninterested in the affairs of mortals, watches pitilessly from high."
 tribal_duel_2_desc_18:0 "The fight is continuing, but it is not going well for you. Every attempt you have made, every strategy taught to you by uncles or friends of your fathers, is easily parried, and you have almost lost control of the situation a couple of times. [target.GetName] seems to be inside of your head, anticipating your every move."
 tribal_duel_2_desc_19:0 "You are making this look easy. Unless some terrible calamity befalls you, there is no way that you are going to lose this match. [target.GetName] is outclassed in every aspect, and you both know that the end is rapidly approaching."
 tribal_duel_2_desc_20:0 "You are both starting to get a little tired, but your pride and sense of honor prevents either of you from showing it...or so you think. You notice that [target.GetName] is swaying back and forth a little too much, almost seeming like a drunken man. Your own breath sounds ragged in your ears, which feel stuffed and are pounding. You cry out, but your tongue feels heavy in your mouth and it's hard to make a sound. Suddenly, [target.GetName] lunges forward and there's no time to think."
 tribal_duel_2_desc_21:0 "Already you know that this fight will have songs written about it, celebrating the combat undertaken here today; the feats of heroism demonstrated by both you and [target.GetName] are worthy to be told throughout the ages. It is truly a pity that only one will leave here alive, for if you and [target.GetName] fought together, all would tremble before you. And yet it must be that only one will leave."
 tribal_duel_2_desc_22:0 "Press on your attack! Don't let [target.GetName] take a moment's rest, but strike! You almost have this, but you must be bold! See how [target.GetName] trembles before you and laugh at their doom. You both know what is about to happen!"

Whilst researching the proud heritage of [ROOT.GetCharacter.GetHerHis] bloodline, [ROOT.GetCharacter.GetEmployer.GetRulerTitle] [ROOT.GetCharacter.GetPraenomen] discovered a small tablet tucked into an alcove, long thought forgotten.\n\nIn near-indecipherable script, it detailed a branch of House [ROOT.GetCharacter.GetFamilyDisplayName], which appears to be connected to the legendary bloodlines, through [SCOPE.sChar('ancestor').GetName].\n\nThis knowledge shall not go to waste."

#The basic idea of these events is to basically be little stories about petty internal politics that result in popularity/corruption for those involved.
#First 5 events are for the popularity scheme. So the general theme should be your ruler's popularity
#For all of the ambitions_inv events there will be two characters that you can refer to when you write
#The first character is your current ruler you get his name in the text like this: [target.GetName]
#The second character will be a random character that has a stat that is greater than the rulers. I'll indicate what stat for each event.
#You get the second characters name in text like this: [scheme_target.GetName]
#Ideally these are something that is based around an interaction between these two characters/the state that results in either
#gaining popularity or the character losing loyalty, or some other effect.
#Just make sure that at the end of the description it allows for a choice from the player in the options.
#You can also write the options and title for these! So have fun with that.
#If you want more options just add them as a new entry with .c after it and put a comment letting me know.
#You can also include relatives of the characters such as their spouse or someone else just let me know and I can make a scope so you can use [GetName] to 
#refer to them
