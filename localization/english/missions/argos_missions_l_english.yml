argos_missions_01_greece:0 "The City of Argos"
argos_missions_01_greece_DESCRIPTION:0 "Argos, the ancient and venerable city that dominates the fertile plain of the Argolid, is ideally situated to consolidate control over her neighbors. With access to the sea, her fruitful fields that are well-nourished by the many rivers of the Argolid, and the tenacious spirit of her inhabitants, Argos is ready to proclaim her name in the world!"
argos_missions_01_greece_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION:0 "This mission will be considered complete when we have established control over the entirety of the Peloponnese."

argos_missions_01_greece_task_1:0 "The City of Argos"
argos_missions_01_greece_task_1_DESC:0 "While the ports of Argos are ideally situated at the mouth of the Sinus Argolicus, we are not the only port city that attracts merchants from far-off lands. We have lived for many years in a state of uneasy coexistence with our neighbors, but perhaps the time has come to eliminate our economic rivals in the region."

argos_missions_01_greece_task_2:0 "A Macedonian Marriage"
argos_missions_01_greece_task_2_DESC:0 "We should find a suitable bride for our Archon, one that reflects his stature as a leading man of our city. No simple arrangement will do; we require a royal bride. Let us send messengers to our friends in Macedon and make our request."

argos_missions_01_greece_task_3:0 "Consolidating the Argolid"
argos_missions_01_greece_task_3_DESC:0 "Situated on the plains of the Argolid as we are, we should extended our natural borders to encompass the entire region. It will be a boon to our fortunes if we are able to secure control here."

argos_missions_01_greece_task_4:0 "Argive Infrastructure"
argos_missions_01_greece_task_4_DESC:0 "While our busy ports keep our bellies filled with grain, there is no reason that we shouldn't be as self-sufficient as possible. Let us invest in the farmlands of Thyrea and increase our holdings in Epidauros, as we shall benefit greatly."

argos_missions_01_greece_task_5:0 "Insult the Spartans"
argos_missions_01_greece_task_5_DESC:0 "The Spartans, your ornery neighbors to the South, seem threatened by our ascent and are spreading falsehoods about us throughout Greece. Strange that such famed fighting men would resort to whispers instead of arms, but two can play the diplomacy game; we should let their people know how we really feel about them."

argos_missions_01_greece_task_6:0 "An Honorable War"
argos_missions_01_greece_task_6_DESC:0 "The time for words has come to an end, and only victory on the battlefield will solve our grievances. Send your men forth, O Argos, and shatter the myth of Spartan supremacy once and for all!"

argos_missions_01_greece_task_7:0 "The End of Sparta"
argos_missions_01_greece_task_7_DESC:0 "We have conquered our ancient rivals to the south, shaking up the balance of power in Greece forevermore. All who hear of our dominance will undoubtedly be impressed by our martial might, and the Spartan helots embrace their liberators."

argos_missions_01_greece_task_8:0 "Arcadia"
argos_missions_01_greece_task_8_DESC:0 "By extending our rule throughout the entirety of Arcadia, we have gained more than just our prestigious reputation; streams of gold pour through your fingertips."

argos_missions_01_greece_task_9:0 "Developing Argos"
argos_missions_01_greece_task_9_DESC:0 "Argos itself is growing, a testament to your skillful leadership. We should undertake a vast building campaign, to make sure that our citizens have all of the facilities that they desire. By taking care of our people, they will take care of us."

argos_missions_01_greece_task_10:0 "A Glorious City"
argos_missions_01_greece_task_10_DESC:0 "Argos is becoming the pre-eminent city in the Peloponnese, having transcended her humble beginnings as a mere city of the Argolid long ago. Each day, new travelers arrive in ships, abandoning the lands of their ancestors to build their future alongside us."

argos_missions_01_greece_task_11:0 "Incorporating the Argolid"
argos_missions_01_greece_task_11_DESC:0 "Years ago, our Archon gave a speech, describing the future as he saw it; one in which Argos was the uncontested master of the Argolid plain. We are pleased to announce that today, this dream has become a reality; the long-awaited victory is here!"

argos_missions_01_greece_task_12:0 "Rebuilding Sparta"
argos_missions_01_greece_task_12_DESC:0 "Because the city of Sparta has submitted to the yoke of Argos, we have nothing to fear from our sister city that our armies so recently destroyed. On the contrary, we should re-invest the spoils of war into Sparta itself, showing the world that we are magnanimous in our triumph."

argos_missions_01_greece_task_13:0 "Argive Dominance"
argos_missions_01_greece_task_13_DESC:0 "As the Inachus River flows into the Sinus Argolicus, filling the gulf with its cascading waters, so too do our armies spill across the Peloponnese, taking the provinces of Laconia and Arcadia and adding them to our possessions."

argos_missions_01_greece_task_14:0 "Securing Olympia"
argos_missions_01_greece_task_14_DESC:0 "We have plans for when we conquer Olympia; we shall fortify the lands and beautify her cities, so that all who visit for the Games are awed by the unquestionable might of Argos. Truly, Olympia shall have the best Caretaker she could possibly imagine."

argos_missions_01_greece_task_15:0 "Priests of Olympus"
argos_missions_01_greece_task_15_DESC:0 "Some advisors are saying that it appears boorish that we have absorbed Olympia directly into our country, claiming that we are no different from squabbling barbarians seeking to grow their holdings. By releasing Olympia as our feudatory, we can maintain the illusion that we do not pull the puppet strings, and perhaps the gods will reward us."

argos_missions_01_greece_task_16:0 "Peloponnesian Dominance"
argos_missions_01_greece_task_16_DESC:0 "Achaea was one of the last holdouts, but the growth of Argos cannot be stopped by those who desire otherwise. By subduing our northern neighbors, we have learned much, lessons that can be applied across our entire realm."

argos_missions_01_greece_task_17:0 "Fortify Korinthos"
argos_missions_01_greece_task_17_DESC:0 "Korinthos is the gateway to the Peloponnese; literally the front door to our possessions in Greece, with strategic value that is undeniable. By bolstering the battlements of distant Korinthos, we shall fortify our defenses and ensure that our enemies cannot simply march into our territory."

argos_missions_01_greece_task_18:0 "A New Administration"
argos_missions_01_greece_task_18_DESC:0 "While Argos has a Republic tradition that is hailed by hoary-haired Senators clinging to their privileges, the inherent dysfunction of democracy is damaging our ambitions. Our government would certainly move in a more streamlined way if we could simply bypass these tiresome traditions. We should seek allies who share our viewpoints..."

argos_missions_01_greece_task_19:0 "Gathering Support"
argos_missions_01_greece_task_19_DESC:0 "Our Archon has been busy as of late, testing the waters for a revolution. Some noble families have outright rejected our overtures, but thankfully, they have not accused you publicly of trying to destroy the state. And although there are those who are happy with the status quo, there are many more who show an interest in what you are promising. The time draws ever nearer."

argos_missions_01_greece_task_20:0 "Taking Over"
argos_missions_01_greece_task_20_DESC:0 "There will never be a better time than the present for undertaking the course you have decided. Months of careful planning have finally concluded, and your supporters await the word. You expect there will be some resistance, but you are not going to let a potential civil war get in the way of your ambitions, are you?"

#Events
me_argos_1_title:0 "A Royal Marriage"
me_argos_1_desc:0 "At the instigation of certain female members of your household, who had decided amongst themselves that an unmarried Archon of Argos was simply an intolerable state of affairs, you have agreed to send an envoy to Macedon in hopes of finding a suitable bride. As the weeks went on, you had quite forgotten about the entire affair, seeking mostly to quiet the nagging of your extended family, and were quite surprised one afternoon when your advisors tell you that not one, but three Antipatrid brides have been sent to Argos; Kassandros must really like you! They are waiting in a villa to meet you, so you splash some water on your face and head down to where they are staying - you will have the evening meal with them.\n\n You are immediately tongue-tied when you are finally in their presence, the irony of which is not lost upon you; how funny it is that such a great orator as yourself, used to giving rousing speeches before the Assemblies, are at a loss for words. Each woman is exceedingly beautiful and exceptionally intelligent, and the conversation lasts for hours before their chaperones excuse them for the evening. You are left alone on your couch, head spinning with wine and the excitement of your possibilities; this will be a difficult decision."
me_argos_1.a:0 "[potential_wife.GetName] is the one for me"
me_argos_1.b:0 "I shall choose [potential_wife_2.GetName] as my wife"
me_argos_1.c:0 "[potential_wife_3.GetName] is the best choice"

me_argos_2_title:0 "Marriage Offer from Argos"
me_argos_2_desc:0 "We hace received a curious proposal from Argos, one of the many city-states in Greece that we have personally guaranteed. It seems that their Archon, an ambitious young fellow that you have already heard a great deal about, has humbly requested that we send a royal bride to him. He comes from a good family, you are told, and this gesture would certainly solidify your reputation in Argos. And while there are certainly a number of unmarried women in our family, do we want to send such a gift to the Argives? Are they truly worthy?"
me_argos_2.a:0 "Great Idea!"
me_argos_2.b:0 "Not a chance!"

me_argos_3_title:0 "Marriage Offer from Argos"
me_argos_3_desc_1:0 "Our embassy to Argos has returned to Pella with a notable difference; whereas three beautiful maidens departed upon boats for Argos, only two have returned. It seems that the Argive leader was overwhelmed by your generosity, only managing to select a wife after a great deal of debate. You hear the wedding celebration was one for the ages, though, and your friend in Argos is certainly pleased with you."
me_argos_3_desc_2:0 "The embassy we sent to Argos returns with frustrating news, and now three women of your family stand before you, faces red from crying and demanding vengeance. It seems that, after all of this discussion about sending a bride to Argos, negotiations fell through at the last minute, and now you have three embarrassed women berating you. With everything going on at the moment, this is a distraction to be sure, but you are not happy with how this is going. You send your kinfolk away with vague promises and remind yourself to deal with the Argives later."
me_argos_3.a:0 "We are pleased by this outcome. Send our best to the newlyweds."
me_argos_3.b:0 "Ludicrous! They dare to reject the honor of an Antipatrid bride? Fools"

The supply of fish is so abundant that prices have fallen through the floor, which has brought great joy to your citizens; the streets of Argos are filled with the tantalizing odors of grilled sardines at all hours, morning and night. Yes, actually...that sounds like what we want for lunch today."
