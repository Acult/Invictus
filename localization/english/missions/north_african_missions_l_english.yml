No more shall we be ruled by councils of magistrates and elders, but we shall finally have a true sovereign to guide us.\n\nNo expense was spared for the coronation ceremony, as the finest wines and luxury foods were imported from abroad, supplementing the traditional dishes of our people. Borne on a litter of silver and ivory, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] was paraded through the streets of [GetProvince('(int32)1465').GetName], showering gifts of golden coins upon the gathered crowds hoping to catch a glimpse of the royal procession.
