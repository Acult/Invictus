nabatea_mission_01_DESCRIPTION: "The harsh sun beats down upon the dusty hills and plains inhabited by the #E Nabateans#!, and the desert wind offers little relief from the oppressive heat that scorches the cracked Earth.\n\nIn this dry and devastated land, where the sand dunes stretch beyond the horizon and past the limits of man's imagination, one can follow the caravans, camels marching one after the other, to the secluded oases where our people live. Sandstone fortifications seemingly appear from nowhere, clustered around the life-giving waters that sustain our populace.\n\nYour eyes do not deceive you, Traveler; this is no mirage that you are witnessing, but the birthplace of a mighty nation."
nabatea_mission_01_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION: "This mission will be considered complete once we have conquered our neighbors, extending our hegemony far into the #E Syrian Desert#! to the north, and have built an illustrious civilization that rivals our peers for glory."
