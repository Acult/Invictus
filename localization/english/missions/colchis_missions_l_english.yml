atropatene_mission_01_DESCRIPTION:0 "The reputation of the Median people is known everywhere; our soothsayers and dream-interpreters, the most knowledgeable in the world, are sought after in all of the capitals of the great Empires. Our magnificent ruler Atropates I Atropatid once ruled as a satrap to both the Persians and the Macedonians, but the death of Alexander and the Wars of the Diadochi have given our people a taste of freedom for the first time in many generations. While many hope to subjugate our realm like so many others have before, our people, guided by the Zoroastrian Faith that sustains us, will not quietly submit to foreign authority. No - we have other plans."
atropatene_mission_01_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION:0 "This mission will be considered complete when the Medes have restored the borders of the famed Cyaraxes, our third king that led our forces to eternal glory."

me_colchis_7_desc:0 "Thanks to our investments and buildup along the Phasis, there has been a strange and rather hilarious increase in the amount of local pheasants which come down from the thick forest heights to drink from the streams and by the river's side itself.

Upone checking it, his superior discovered yet another pocket of golden veins running through the hillside. Colchis is truly the land of golden sand! \nHowever, some believe that this deposit would best serve us being outsourced to private miners. A strange man, known as the 'Gold Sniffer,' has arrived to offer his services in exchange for being allowed to privately handle the gold."
