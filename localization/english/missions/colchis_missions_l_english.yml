atropatene_mission_01_DESCRIPTION:0 "The reputation of the Median people is known everywhere; our soothsayers and dream-interpreters, the most knowledgeable in the world, are sought after in all of the capitals of the great Empires. Our magnificent ruler Atropates I Atropatid once ruled as a satrap to both the Persians and the Macedonians, but the death of Alexander and the Wars of the Diadochi have given our people a taste of freedom for the first time in many generations. While many hope to subjugate our realm like so many others have before, our people, guided by the Zoroastrian Faith that sustains us, will not quietly submit to foreign authority. No - we have other plans."
atropatene_mission_01_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION:0 "This mission will be considered complete when the Medes have restored the borders of the famed Cyaraxes, our third king that led our forces to eternal glory."

colchis_missions_task_02_desc:0 "Built atop vast limestone deposits and on a defensible hilly area at the edge of the plains, Tsikhegoji, known to the Greeks as Archaeopolis, sat at a great crossroads of trade and directly profited from the jewel and precious metal mines found within the mountains overlooking it. Thus, it was both a strategic and presitigous place for a fort - but perhaps we can create a more fitting castle for the one who occupies the Colchian throne."

colchis_missions_task_03:0 "The Golden River"
colchis_missions_task_03_desc:0 "The Phasis, named for the glittering nuggets which hide among the rocks and pebbles below, is the lifeline of trade and communication from our capital to the greater Pontos. We must control it and utilize it as the true arm of our economy."

me_colchis_6_desc:0 "The castle stands tall and mighty, bearing down on the merchant wagons and messengers who cross the beaten roads spread out before it. From here, a great deal of the local trade and protection can be administered, and many people of good station have flocked to its ramparts, which are speckled with sparkling stones."
me_colchis_6.a:0 "This protective bulwark will shine!"

me_colchis_7_title:0 "Land of the Pheasants"
me_colchis_7_desc:0 "Thanks to our investments and buildup along the Phasis, there has been a strange and rather hilarious increase in the amount of local pheasants which come down from the thick forest heights to drink from the streams and by the river's side itself. While they are a cute addition to the natural landscape, the small flocks of them are starting to get in the way of people attempting to go about their daily business.\nHow should be deal with this phenomenon before it becomes a larger issue for our farmers and workers?"
me_colchis_7.a:0 "Poultry shall fill the plates of our people."
me_colchis_7.b:0 "Perhaps other lands have a taste for this bird?"
me_colchis_7.c:0 "That sounds like a local problem..."

me_colchis_8_title:0 "Hide Sifting"
me_colchis_8_desc:0 "Our people are accustomed to taking the fluffy hides of sheep and dipping them into the river Phasis. If one is lucky, they may pull out their hide and it will show a color like the sun, having collected flakes of gold. Recently, a farmer, who's name is not known, found some great deposit of golden nuggets and parts in the river. Many have come down from the villages, from the workshops, from the farms, in order to try their own hand in sifting wealth from the river. This development has some in the court worried about civil productivity..."
me_colchis_8.a:0 "Let the people flock to the shores of the river, reap the wealth of their home, and prosper."
me_colchis_8.b:0 "The crown shall control the dredging of the river, for it is the crown's land."

me_colchis_9_title:0 "A Peace of the Past"
me_colchis_9_desc:0 "A lowly wanderer has come into the court with a large grin on their face. In their hands they hold a simple rock, which they present to all present and claim a mythical origin. They say that the rock is one of the same stones which Iason of the Argonauts threw among the warriors he grew from sewn dragon's teeth during his trials in Kolchis - found in the bed of the Phasis itself which the Argonauts sailed in their escape. These rocks, which distracted the warriors, allowed Iason to defeat them, helping him steal the Golden Fleece which the land held sacred. This rock, even if truly a relic of that fight, assisted in the defeat of our legendary leader. How can we hold it in good light?"
me_colchis_9.a:0 "This treasure will serve as an object of curiosity for Greeks everywhere!"
me_colchis_9.b:0 "We shall ritually destroy this rock, denouncing those piratical Argonauts."
me_colchis_9.c:0 "Perhaps the Greeks would buy Iason's legacy..."
me_colchis_9.d:0 "It is just a rock, nothing more. Dismiss this false-speaking daydreamer."

me_colchis_14_title:0 "Guarding Roses"
me_colchis_14_desc:0 "Constuction of the improved fortifications is ongoing, but it has caused a great strain in our resources. This flower of a city has an intensive growing process, and we shall need to invest further into it if it will become a bastion of our people in times of hardship."
me_colchis_14.a:0 "To afford such fortifications, we will have to make the plains of roses profitable."
me_colchis_14.b:0 "More troops defending the wall will need more food."
me_colchis_14.c:0 "We shall quickly take the undefended mountain passes which lead overlook the city."

me_colchis_15_title:0 "Roses Gold"
me_colchis_15_desc:0 "The Rose Mines have been plentiful in their metal ores. Yet, on a rather unpeculiar day, one of the local miners believed he saw a bright glimmer break through the dirt and soot covering all the rocks. Upone checking it, his superior discovered yet another pocket of golden veins running through the hillside. Colchis is truly the land of golden sand! \nHowever, some believe that this deposit would best serve us being outsourced to private miners. A strange man, known as the 'Gold Sniffer,' has arrived to offer his services in exchange for being allowed to privately handle the gold."
me_colchis_15.a:0 "Turn the City of Rose to gold production at once."
me_colchis_15.b:0 "Let those who would exploit our gold deposits come and work for us."
me_colchis_15.b.t:0 "A man called the #Y Gold Sniffer#! will join our nation as a minor character"

A trusted advisor to the high priest has come forth bearing a remarkable thing. It has caused disbelief in the court. In his hands, he held a ram's fleece... so golden, so shining, so glorious in its coloration that it could have only been divine. Yet, there was one patch missing in the display.\n\nGrabbing the strand we aquaired from the Greeks at Phasis, he put it to that same patch, without prompting, and displayed a complete masterpiece - it was as if the strand had vanished, and confirmed that the fleece was genuine. Some belive the gods presented a lone farmer with a golden ram so that another fleece could belong to Kolchis, others believe the old relic had simply made its way back home from Thessalian shores, so the stories and rumors go..."
