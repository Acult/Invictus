etruria_roman_incursion:0 "The Roman Incursion"
etruria_roman_incursion_DESCRIPTION:0 "With the loss of Veia to the growing city of Rome still in our memories, it is hard to imagine that their quest for power and domination will stop here. How long before each of our loosely-allied cities finds a Roman host before its gate, demanding surrender while threatening obliteration. But they forget we, the Rasenna, once ruled Rome, and we may yet again..."
etruria_roman_incursion_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION:0 "This mission will be considered complete when the Etruscan people have neutralized the Roman threat."
etruria_roman_incursion_BUTTON_TOOLTIP:0 "Remove those pesky Romans!"

#Mission Tasks
etruria_roman_incursion_task_1:0 "Pesky Neighbors"
etruria_roman_incursion_task_1_DESC:0 "Rome and its domain are right on our southern border, encroaching upon our areas of control on land and sea. This has led to a few… problems. But perhaps we can deal with them diplomatically and maybe even gain something from all of this. There is much they have taken from us."
etruria_roman_incursion_task_2:0 "Roma Delenda Est"
etruria_roman_incursion_task_2_DESC:0 "It is no longer a question - Rome must be defeated on the field of battle. However, it is still a city we once ruled and built up, which we set on the path to grand success. What part of Rome do we really have a problem with?"
etruria_roman_incursion_task_3:0 "Reform the Military"
etruria_roman_incursion_task_3_DESC:0 "The seven hills of Rome provide a substantial system of fortification and defense. If we are to even threaten that we shall take it by force, we'll need to be better equipped in order to march on such a well-defended city."
etruria_roman_incursion_task_4:0 "Secret Invasions"
etruria_roman_incursion_task_4_DESC:0 "While we are a strong and proud people, there is nothing wrong with having extra advantages here and there. If we can weaken Rome from the inside, they'll be a more vulnerable and timid foe on the battlefield as much as in the senate chambers."
etruria_roman_incursion_task_5:0 "Return of the Senones"
etruria_roman_incursion_task_5_DESC:0 "There is a group of people the Romans still greatly fear after all this time - perhaps we still do as well. The man named Brennus once sacked their city and soiled their reputation. Perhaps if we bring those barbarous warriors into a partnership the Romans will think twice before considering war."
etruria_roman_incursion_task_6:0 "Celtic Ways"
etruria_roman_incursion_task_6_DESC:0 "We've become closer to the Senones since our union with them against mutual foes. Perhaps there is more they could teach us if only we allowed them greater freedom within our society."
etruria_roman_incursion_task_7:0 "The Carthaginian Card"
etruria_roman_incursion_task_7_DESC:0 "While we often compete with them over control of the waterways, we have joined forces with Carthage before against our enemies. Surely they will realize the economic and influential danger Rome will pose if it grows powerful enough to fight us."
etruria_roman_incursion_task_8:0 "Carthaginian Ways"
etruria_roman_incursion_task_8_DESC:0 "We've become closer to the Carthaginians since our union with them against mutual foes. Perhaps there is more they could teach us if only we allowed them greater freedom within our society."
etruria_roman_incursion_task_9:0 "Epirote Ambitions"
etruria_roman_incursion_task_9_DESC:0 "The king of Epirus, young Pyrrhos, has many eyes upon him as one of the lights of the future in these trying times across the Hellenic world. Perhaps he can be our light and lay waste to the Roman problem we have been experiencing."
etruria_roman_incursion_task_10:0 "Greek Ways"
etruria_roman_incursion_task_10_DESC:0 "We've become closer to the Epirotes since our union with them against mutual foes. Perhaps there is more they could teach us if only we allowed them greater freedom within our society."
etruria_roman_incursion_task_11:0 "Roma Debet Esse Nostra"
etruria_roman_incursion_task_11_DESC:0 "Rome has forgotten that we were once its rulers, and that it shared many of our ideals and culture. Let us not fight them, but convince them to return them to the fold."
etruria_roman_incursion_task_12:0 "Woo the Roman Vassals"
etruria_roman_incursion_task_12_DESC:0 "It is funny that Rome itself is not terribly large. What we have found is that their strength lies half in their many enslaved dependents. Perhaps our silver-tongued merchants can play to their sympathies."
etruria_roman_incursion_task_13:0 "Campanian Insurgency"
etruria_roman_incursion_task_13_DESC:0 "It is funny that Rome itself is not terribly large. What we have found is that their strength lies half in their many enslaved dependents. Perhaps our silver-tongued agents can play to their sympathies."
etruria_roman_incursion_task_14:0 "The End of Roman Domination"
etruria_roman_incursion_task_14_DESC:0 "We have done everything in our power to pull Rome's strength from underneath it and bolster our forces, through alliances and subversion. Let us now play our hand and see how the weakened eagle responds."
etruria_roman_incursion_task_15:0 "The Fate of Rome"
etruria_roman_incursion_task_15_DESC:0 "Rome is now firmly held under our foot, begging for mercy. There are many things we could do here. What to do? Oh what to do?"
etruria_roman_incursion_task_16:0 "Stealing Epirote Gains"
etruria_roman_incursion_task_16_DESC:0 "While Pyrrhus and his men have been valuable allies in our conflict with Rome, it would be foolish to allow the Roman threat to simply be replaced by a Greek one so quickly. We need to maintain our claim over all the peninsula and remove the Epirote camps before they grow roots."
etruria_roman_incursion_task_17:0 "A More Peaceful Italia"
etruria_roman_incursion_task_17_DESC:0 "Rome, the greatest threat to the stability of Italia, has finally been subdued. Rejoice!"

#Flavour Events
me_etruria.1.title:0 "$etruria_roman_incursion$"
me_etruria.1.desc:0 "We and Rome have been intertwined within the bonds of war in the many years past, for good and bad, among each other or in the proxy of others. But Veia… Veia was too far. Let our bitter relationship end with only one of us standing on top."
me_etruria.1.a:0 "It is a dangerous game we play."

me_etruria.2.title:0 "$etruria_roman_incursion_task_1$: Ostia vs Velcal"
me_etruria.2.desc:0 "Velcal (Latin Vulci) has been a major center of maritime trade with many goods, especially those from Sardinia, coming into its port just down the river. Yet, Rome has become a rival center for trade, mirroring Velcal's model with its own port at the mouth of the Tiber: Ostia. If Velcal itself and the general trade in the north is to maintain its strength, we must address this competition between successful ports."
me_etruria.2.a:0 "Expand our trading network and push out a new fleet of trade ships."
me_etruria.2.b:0 "Merchants will buy and sell where they feel safe. Let us protect them."
me_etruria.2.bt:0 "#Y [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetName]#! gains a fleet in #E [GetProvince('(int32)22').GetName]#! with a good admiral.\nThis fleet consists of #Y 5#! Triremes, #Y 2#! Hexeres and #Y 1#! Octere."
me_etruria.2.bt2:0 "#G 3#! #Y Citizens#! @citizens! appear in the territory of #E [GetProvince('(int32)22').GetName]#!"
me_etruria.2.c:0 "Strike a deal with the Ostian merchants to redistribute their imported goods."
me_etruria.2.d:0 "Have one of our visiting merchants take the port of Ostia down a notch."

me_etruria.3.title:0 "$etruria_roman_incursion_task_1$: An Etruscan or Roman God?"
me_etruria.3.desc:0 "A high priest from Veia (Latin Veii) came before the ruler and knelt before the high council as he spoke his plea: "Daughter of Tin, daughter of Uni, the Romans have stolen you from us! Great Menrva, you who grew from the head of your father, you who cast down the blood-red bolts of light alongside his, your image is stolen away and used by the Romans for their 'Minerva'. Won't you, wise men save our goddess from the Romans who wish to turn her away from us?" All men must kneel and devote their lives to the gods - how will we solve this problem?"
me_etruria.3.a:0 "Let them pervert their Veii. We shall build the goddess a greater temple at Velcal."
me_etruria.3.b:0 "Let us convince the Romans to maintain the city's traditions."
me_etruria.3.c:0 "What of it? Where was the great Menrva when Veia fell?"

me_etruria.4.title:0 "$etruria_roman_incursion_task_1$: The Predicament of Veia"
me_etruria.4.desc:0 "It has been over a generation since the Romans took Veia. Our grandfathers remember the apathy they had to the conflict. They did not fear Rome then, and even now they do not see its true potential as our doom - they have forgotten the slaughter which Marcus Furius Camillus committed. Veia remains an important boundary between our two domains, and if we could inspire the people to revolt and return it to us, we would have that much greater of a chance when dealing with Rome later on. But we must tread carefully, because the Romans will not just sit back and watch for long."
me_etruria.4.a:0 "Send our agents and incite rebellion among the poor. We must again control Veia."
me_etruria.4.a.tt:0 "A new king in #E [GetProvince('(int32)16').GetName]#! will take his place as a #Y general#!"
me_etruria.4.b:0 "Veia was once the richest city. Remind the merchants of this."
me_etruria.4.c:0 "Conflict can wait. For now, let us 'invest' in our future territory."
me_etruria.4.c.tt:0 "These #E [GetCountry('ROM').GetReligion.GetName] [GetCountry('ROM').GetPrimaryCulture.GetName]#! pops will appear in #E [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName]#!:\n#Y 1#! noble @nobles! |  #Y 2#! citizens @citizens!"

me_etruria.4.d:0 "The situation is too delicate to act now. We wait."

me_etruria.5.title:0 "$etruria_roman_incursion_task_1$: The Loss of Veii"
me_etruria.5.desc:0 "A messenger has just arrived, my consul. He says there has been a rebellion in Veii. The city and its surrounding territory have slaughtered the Roman garrison there and have proclaimed their loyalty to the Etruscan League. Those northerners are no doubt the cause of all this."
me_etruria.5.a:0 "So, they have made the first move."

me_etruria.6.title:0 "$etruria_roman_incursion_task_2$: The Idea or the Place?"
me_etruria.6.desc:0 "While all of us agree that Rome is a great threat and that its defeat will lead to a new golden age for our people, not all Etruscans can agree as to what about Rome is truly the problem. Some would say that the city itself is the root of our problem. Others would claim that it is the Roman spirit, their relentlessness, which we should fear. We must decide what the primary objective of this conflict is, so that the people can be united behind that goal."
me_etruria.6.a:0 "We will tear away every stone from the seven hills."
me_etruria.6.b:0 "Rome is just a place. But its people, they have wronged us countless times."
