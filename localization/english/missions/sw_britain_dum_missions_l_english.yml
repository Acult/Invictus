The dig site has been greatly expanded, allowing easier access into the ground, and our slaves are now working harder than ever before to meet their quotas.

 01_sw_britain_dum_3_desc: "Although our people are unmatched when it comes to fighting on land, the recent initiative to embrace the seafaring life has caught some of our tribesmen unawares and has caused dissension. Despite the grumbling, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has been unrelenting in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] demand to master the waves, for the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle] truly believes that our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] destiny involves mastering the ways of the ocean. The opportunities for trade are simply too great, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] has argued, and we must become the strongest naval power in our region.\n\nNow that [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] has accumulated stockpiles of wood, cloth and stone - the goods necessary to build harbors and ships to fill them - there is no turning back now; [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] is on course to grow her fleet."

Still, the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle] is happy this day, regardless of the reason for the consensus.\n\nOur warriors, the blood of our enemies barely dried on their blades, seem to have caught a taste for battle and are now clamoring to continue their plunder and raiding.

It seems that our Tribal Chief wants to request that the Druids come to visit Stonehenge themselves and conduct religious ceremonies that will bless the Dumnonian people.\n\nIt remains to be seen if they will accept, however, as this would mean that we have received their tacet blessing for violently seizing this holy site for ourselves."

 01_sw_britain_dum_12_title: "The Harvest Festival:The Beginning"
 01_sw_britain_dum_12_desc: "One of the oldest traditions of the Dumnonian people are the religious rites honoring the harvest, for it was not so long ago that our people knew the pangs of hunger intimately. For many years, our tribesmen have not been able to afford the costs involved with the Festival, which was once connected with the worship of #E Bel#! and the changing of the seasons many lifetimes ago, but it seems that these days have passed.\n\nIn an attempt to do right by the old gods of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has announced that the beloved #E Harvest Festival#! is taking place in one month's time in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] and that all are welcome to attend."

It was then revealed that they would entrust the Dumnonian Tribal Chief with some of the secret wisdom of their Order, and they spoke into the evening, long after the last logs had burned themselves out in the fire.\n\nWhen they left the next morning for #E Carnutia#!, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] refused to divulge what was discussed, repeating the same thing over and over."
