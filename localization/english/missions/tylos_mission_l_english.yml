# Tylos mission tree
tylos_missions: "Revival of Babylon"
tylos_missions_DESCRIPTION: "On our island of #E Tylos#!, we currently walk along the razor's edge; 'protected' by the #E Seleukid Empire#!, who casts a hungry eye on our wealthy ports and gemstones, we are surrounded by aggressive Republics that would love to annex our borders. Needless to say, both friend and foe have set themselves up against us, and only time will tell if we are able to achieve a long-forgotten dream - the #E Revival of Babylon.#!"
tylos_missions_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION: "This mission will be considered complete when #E Tylos#! has built itself up into a mighty nation that can claim the mantle of the ancient power of #E Babylon#!."

tylos_missions_task_2: "Export Of Sindones"
tylos_missions_task_2_DESC: "In order to ensure that our exports reach their intended markets, we must have the proper fleets and the technical know-how to patrol our waters - there is much work to be done. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil4!"
tylos_missions_task_3: "The Three Temples"
tylos_missions_task_3_DESC: "In one of the most ancient quarters of #E Tylos#!, an area that the locals treat as holy ground, it has been proposed that we build a Grand Theater.

tylos_missions_task_6: "The Memory of Babylon"
tylos_missions_task_6_DESC: "Many claim the authority of a long-gone era without putting in the work to earn the right to do so, but no one can make the same statements about us. The time approaches whereupon we shall claim #E Babylon#! for ourselves. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@india_mil23!"
tylos_missions_task_7: "A Memory Of Tilmun"
tylos_missions_task_7_DESC: "In our corner of the world, people still speak of 'Tilmun', a naval power that once dominated these lands by controlling the trade routes - a path that we are upon ourselves. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil19!"
tylos_missions_task_8: "A Gulf War"
tylos_missions_task_8_DESC: "With the blessings of our overlords the #E Seleukid Empire#!, we can wage regional conflicts and attempt to steal the holdings of our neighboring Republics. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil15!"
tylos_missions_task_9: "A Rich Memory"
tylos_missions_task_9_DESC: "In days of old, it is said that the Babylonians administered their lands using a specialized type of bureaucracy, and while this was very long ago, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] remembers the benefits of using a similar style of governance and desires it for [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil12!"

tylos_missions_task_12: "The Isle of Akar"
tylos_missions_task_12_DESC: "Perhaps we might go about purchasing some lands from the #E Seleukid Empire#!? Their holdings are so vast that they might be willing to part with two small islands, especially if the price is right. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@egypt_mil19!"
tylos_missions_task_13: "The Strait of Hormizad"
tylos_missions_task_13_DESC: "The time is at hand to see if we can seize the #E Straight of Hormizad#! by any means possible. Although we prefer a diplomatic solution, going to war is not out of the question. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil17!"
tylos_missions_task_14: "The Flowers of Enzak"
tylos_missions_task_14_DESC: "Long ago, the deity #T Inzak#!, or Enzak as he is called in some dialects, protected and blessed the Tilmun civilization - could we, too, seek his favor? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil2!"

tylos_missions_task_16: "Exporting Babylonian Canes"
tylos_missions_task_16_DESC: "The #E Foundry#! is an impressive achievement and once we understand how to properly build them, we should construct one in our capital immediately - our exports, particularly of canes, will expand quite rapidly once we do so. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil1!"

tylos_missions_task_21: "East Arabian Shipping"
tylos_missions_task_21_DESC: "While we certainly have plenty of room in [GetProvince('(int32)7202').GetName] for future growth, the amount of trade volumes that we handle have encouraged us to develop the nearby province of [GetProvince('(int32)7203').GetName] so that we might further our shipping potential. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@egypt_mil23!"
tylos_missions_task_22: "The Pearl Bank"
tylos_missions_task_22_DESC: "The amount of gemstones that we mine from our provinces leads us to believe that there might be other locations that have such natural wealth - we should see if we can find any new sites.\n\n#Y This will start an event chain.#!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil6!"

tylos_missions_task_24:0 "Develop the Strait"
tylos_missions_task_24_DESC: "The prime location of [GetProvince('(int32)7210').GetName] is begging for infrastructural improvements, and for obvious reasons; this province controls the Strait that leads into the Sinus Persicus, making it supremely important. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@egypt_mil10!"
tylos_missions_task_25: "Production of Sindones"
tylos_missions_task_25_DESC: "There is always a strong demand for cotton textiles, both at home and abroad. We must do what we can to increase our production! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil14!"

me_tylos_1_title: "The Throne of Babylon"
me_tylos_1_desc: "Hundreds of years ago, the Sages and Seers of [GetProvince('(int32)918').GetName] must have peered deeply into the future through the Fabric of the Stars, and surely they knew of the foretold hour of their destruction at the hands of #E Cyrus#! - the nadir of its long and rich history.\n\nYet there must have been consolation, as well, in the knowledge that all would not be lost forever, but that [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] would forge anew what had been broken and lost so long ago. It brings the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] joy to see the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle] assume [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] rightful place on the throne of Babylon."
me_tylos_1.a: "Babylon has risen again!"

me_tylos_2_title: "A Rich Memory"
me_tylos_2_desc: "In days of old, it is said that the Babylonian people were guided in their affairs by a powerful bureaucracy, one that was able to effectively adminster government while maintaining the blessings of the gods. There was a central figure known as the #E Lugal#! that ruled like a King would, assigning important tasks to deputies and advisors.\n\nNow that we have reformed the ancient nation of #E Tilmun#!, claiming by rights the authority and gravitas of that long-gone state, it has been proposed that we go one step further and actually adopt the #E Babylon Bureaucracy#! as our own manner of governance.\n\n[ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has argued that this will only bring legitimacy to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] and shall do wonders to increase our international prestige, yet others claim this is a monarchy in all but name."
me_tylos_2.a: "We believe in [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName]!"

me_tylos_3_title: "The Memory of Babylon"
me_tylos_3_desc: "For many years now, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has been guided by a singular vision - reclaiming the glory of #E Babylon#! for the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] people, and this includes driving the invaders out of the city itself and purifying it in a series of rituals.\n\nNow that we stand in a position to act upon our impulses, all that remains to be determined is how far our levies will have to go."

me_tylos.4.desc: "A most fortuitous discovery! While we were busy constructing our Grand Theater in [GetProvince('(int32)7202').GetName], our diggers uncovered what appeared to be a section of an old, abandoned temple. Greatly excited by this discovery, the excavations continued, and not one but three small temples were discovered in the heart of the city.\n\nWhile the center of Tylos was always considered to be among the most valuable real estate in our entire nation, there has been a mad dash amongst the nobility and the well-off [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] citizens to buy properties near the excavation site. We will one day restore the Temples to their true glory - what a gift from the gods!"
