me_rhodes_1_desc:0 "Our commercial ties with [GetCharacter('(int32)42').GetName] was what led the Antigonid Kingdom to lay siege to our homeland. During the siege of Rhodes [GetCharacter('(int32)42').GetName] even sent a small garrison of 500 men into Rhodes through the harbor during the siege to reinforce our troops. Our relationship with Egypt is very close but these are only informal ties. It has been proposed that we prepare an offer to send to [GetCharacter('(int32)42').GetName] requesting that we formally ally ourselves."

me_rhodes_2_desc:0 "The island of Rhodes has recently repelled a massive invasion from the Antigonids led by [GetCharacter('(int32)38').GetName]. Our close commercial ties with Rhodes were the initial cause of the invasion. It is almost certain that if we do not seek to protect Rhodes they will eventually be absorbed into the Antigonid realm. A diplomat from Rhodes has approched us with an offer for an alliance, how shall the we respond?"
