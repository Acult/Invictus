atropatene_mission_01_task_02_DESC:0 "The sacred prophet Zoroaster, whose teachings have been so impactful to our people throughout the years, was born in the province of [GetProvince('(int32)1627').GetName].

atropatene_mission_01_task_02_tt:0 "Ardabil will become a city, all Zoroastrian nations will get an opinion boost of us, and we will get various claims on the surrounding provinces."
atropatene_mission_01_task_03:0 "Strengthen the Median Identity"
atropatene_mission_01_task_03_DESC:0 "While we open our homes and hearts to all peoples, regardless of their creed or culture, we admit that a country predicated upon Median power must have Medes in predominant positions - we strongly desire that all eventually adopt our ways. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil13!"

atropatene_mission_01_task_04:0 "Prosperity of Glittering Salt"
atropatene_mission_01_task_04_DESC:0 "The coasts of the Mare Hyrcanum are an ever-giving source of wealth for our people; not only do we gather fish from its abundant waters, but the coastal flats provide us with the vital resource of salt - perhaps there are steps we can take to expand production of this tradegood. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil4!"
atropatene_mission_01_task_05:0 "The Holy City of Ganzak"
atropatene_mission_01_task_05_DESC:0 "The city of [GetProvince('(int32)1515').GetName], which already has a reputation for having a pious populace, has room for a series of infrastructure improvements that we believe would do wonders for this area economically. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil16!"

atropatene_mission_01_task_06:0 "Mystical Kashmar"
atropatene_mission_01_task_06_DESC:0 "The region of Kashmar is a sacred place to us, for in this province grows a tree which sprouted from a sapling carried by the Prophet from a grove in Paradise. Because of this, there are many pilgrims that travel to this area, hoping to recline in the shade of the magnificent tree. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil7!"
atropatene_mission_01_task_07:0 "Reinstate the Magi"
atropatene_mission_01_task_07_DESC:0 "Our former priestly caste, known as the Magi, have been floundering for years, removed from the vital resources they need to function and take care of their priestly duties.

atropatene_mission_01_task_08:0 "For My Son"
atropatene_mission_01_task_08_DESC:0 "Just because the task ahead of us is enormous and will be difficult to execute does not mean that justice does not cry out - we must do everything that we can to make sure that all wrongs have been made right, no matter what the cost will be. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil1!"
atropatene_mission_01_task_08_tt:0 "Seleucus I Nicator needs to die for the betrayal and murder of Perdiccas, the son-in-law of Atropates I Atropatid. The other betrayers, Peithon and Antigenes have already perished. Perhaps assassination would be possible..."
atropatene_mission_01_task_09:0 "The Atropatene Treasury"
atropatene_mission_01_task_09_DESC:0 "If we are able to properly build up [GetProvince('(int32)1515').GetName], making it a region that truly rivals other capital cities in greatness and stature, the increased tax revenues that we would take in would require that a royal treasury be constructed. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@egypt_mil19!"

atropatene_mission_01_task_10_DESC:0 "The Avesta, the collection of sacred writings that guides the footsteps of our people, was compiled in the dusty valleys of the mountains near Persis.

atropatene_mission_01_task_11:0 "Travels of the Royal Spirit"
atropatene_mission_01_task_11_DESC:0 "The city of [GetProvince('(int32)4985').GetName], whose people are known for their fine silverwork, is an area that is worth developing, for multiple reasons. Not only is it the capital of its province, but we could take advantage of its excellent location on the coasts of the Mare Hyrcanum and truly make it a place that the locals want to live in. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil18!"
atropatene_mission_01_task_12:0 "The Faith of the Kadousioi"
atropatene_mission_01_task_12_DESC:0 "The Kadousioi are the descendants of fierce tribesmen that settled down in our region after wandering for many years. Although they have lived among us for as long as any can remember, from time to time, they get disgruntled and they riot en masse, a tendency that we believe could be discouraged by building public works in the territories that they inhabit. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil3!"
atropatene_mission_01_task_13:0 "Civilize the Cadusians"
atropatene_mission_01_task_13_DESC:0 "We firmly believe that the noble Cadusian people, although they have a tradition and history to be proud of, would be much happier and stronger as a people if they embraced our ways; a process that we hope to encourage however we can. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil3!"

atropatene_mission_01_task_15:0 "Consolidate Lake Matiene"
atropatene_mission_01_task_15_DESC:0 "In the dusty interior of our mountains, the waters of Lake Matiene are a welcome sight after days of traveling through the wastes. Because we value this region so much, we should do everything we can to gather the territories that surround the lake under our direct leadership. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@persia_mil12!"

atropatene_mission_01_task_16_DESC:0 "[GetProvince('(int32)1515').GetName], the city that is like the shining light in the firmament, has seen a large influx of visitors lately; people flock to our capital in droves, hoping to seek their fortunes in the beating heart of Zoroastrian thought. Soon enough, this will be the greatest city in the region by far - a true metropolis. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@persia_mil5!"

atropatene_mission_01_task_17:0 "The Obscurity of Druj"
atropatene_mission_01_task_17_DESC:0 "There are religious teachings that are popular among the people but are not based upon sound theology, and embracing the heretical teachings known as 'Druj', a word whose very roots are based in deception, has become in fashion. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@persia_mil9!"
atropatene_mission_01_task_18:0 "The Light of Asha"
atropatene_mission_01_task_18_DESC:0 "Even though submitting one's self to the Truth can be a difficult endeavor, there is a period of growth that can only be attained after suffering through the embarrassment that comes from being exposed; all beliefs which are encapsulated in the teachings of Asha. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil3!"

atropatene_mission_01_task_20_DESC:0 "Whether one calls it by its local name, Mazandaran, or one uses the names the Greeks have given it, Mare Hyrcanum, the landlocked sea that is close to us provides opportunities for trade that we are benefitting immensely from. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil19!"
