#Missions

01_zhangzhung_missions_task_1:0 "Tension on the Border"
01_zhangzhung_missions_task_1_DESC:0 "We are constantly receiving reports that foreign raiders are crossing our border, wandering through our lands as they please and attacking the local tribesmen if they resist their trespassing. In order to protect our people from these bandits, we should seize their province of Chomolangma, pushing them back all the way up into the mountains. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@persia_mil20!"

01_zhangzhung_missions_task_2:0 "Foothills of Terai"
01_zhangzhung_missions_task_2_DESC:0 "The virgin forests of Terai, pristine as they are, will be no real barrier to any southern nation that decides to stir up trouble for us; we should occupy the province immediately, lest we find ourselved faces with an unpleasant surprise at an inopportune moment. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@india_mil12!"

01_zhangzhung_missions_task_3:0 "Finishing the Tsang"
01_zhangzhung_missions_task_3_DESC:0 "Realizing that we will never be able to live in a state of peaceful coexistence with our enemies to the east, it has been decided that we must rule them directly. Glorious battle awaits our soldiers! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@persia_mil18!"

01_zhangzhung_missions_task_4:0 "The Spoils of War"
01_zhangzhung_missions_task_4_DESC:0 "In addition to the usual gold and slaves that accompanies victory in matters of war, we are now heirs to the accumulated knowledge of the Tsang; we should send our scholars to their former capital to see what wisdom they can glean from the locals. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@india_mil20!"

01_zhangzhung_missions_task_5:0 "Rumors of Gemstones"
01_zhangzhung_missions_task_5_DESC:0 "Traders returning from our settlements far to the north speak of an excited discovery among the locals - there are rumors of dazzling green and red gemstones that can be found in the mountains. We should send an expidition to see if we can locate the source of this fabled wealth. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@egypt_mil19!"

01_zhangzhung_missions_task_6:0 "Uniting the Bon"
01_zhangzhung_missions_task_6_DESC:0 "For the first time in recent memory, what was once imagined to be a dream - the political unification of the Bon faithful into a mighty nation - is tantalizingly within grasp. We should prepare the claims necessary to venture deep within the mountains. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@persia_mil17!"

01_zhangzhung_missions_task_7:0 "Protecting the North"
01_zhangzhung_missions_task_7_DESC:0 "Now that we have secured our natural borders, we have decided to systematically go through our provinces and bolster our system of fortifications. The precarious situation in the west demands our attention; we have powerful neighbors there, and no desire to see their armies winding through our mountain passes. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil1!"
gilgit_tt:0 "We need at least two forts in the province of #Y Gilgit#!."

01_zhangzhung_missions_task_8:0 "Roof of the World"
01_zhangzhung_missions_task_8_DESC:0 "Although the terrain is difficult to live in, much like our own, the mountains of [GetProvince('(int32)6769').GetArea.GetName] are inhabited by a weak people that we could easily destroy and drive away. Controlling their region would not only improve our security, but would solidify our hold over the local trade routes even further. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@persia_mil15!"

01_zhangzhung_missions_task_9:0 "Entering the Basin"
01_zhangzhung_missions_task_9_DESC:0 "The fertile oases of the Tarim Basin glitter in the distance, with promises of exotic treasures and sumptuous wealth floating in alongside the desert breezes. The inhabitants that live there are very different from our own people, and will fight dearly to hold on to what they have - we should prepare ourselves for a tough campaign. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@persia_mil14!"

01_zhangzhung_missions_task_10:0 "The North"
01_zhangzhung_missions_task_10_DESC:0 "Our wars for control of the Tarim Basin continue, taking our soldiers farther from our homes than they have ever been. Hopefully, their travels abroad will result in victory for our people! We cannot accept anything but this outcome! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@persia_mil1!"

01_zhangzhung_missions_task_11:0 "Bon Betrayal"
01_zhangzhung_missions_task_11_DESC:0 "Not all who live in the lands of our foes are actually our enemies; on the contrary, there are those who understand that we would be better rulers than their own leaders and desire to see us assume power. These informers in the local populations are willing to advise us by revealing weaknesses in their fortifications, but they will want to be paid dearly for the information. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@india_mil17!"

01_zhangzhung_missions_task_12:0 "The Walls of Gilgit"
01_zhangzhung_missions_task_12_DESC:0 "Because we have constructed fortresses throughout [GetProvince('(int32)5593').GetArea.GetName], our engineers have learned a great deal and are now seasoned architects. In the future, they will be able to remember what they learned while laboring in the mountains and hopefully benefit from these lessons. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@persia_mil7!"

01_zhangzhung_missions_task_13:0 "Searching for Olmo Lungring"
01_zhangzhung_missions_task_13_DESC:0 "Our ancient stories say that Tonpa Shenrab, the legendary founder of the Bon religion in our homeland, came from a land far to the west known as Olmo Lungring. Now that we control the Pamir Mountains, we should send riders west to search for this mythical region. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@persia_mil16!"

01_zhangzhung_missions_task_14:0 "The South"
01_zhangzhung_missions_task_14_DESC:0 "The petty tyrants and despots that cling to their fiefs throughout the Tarim Basin are on the verge of being defeated forever, but only if our people can persevere through the difficult days ahead. We march for their capitals at sunrise! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@persia_mil2!"

01_zhangzhung_missions_task_15:0 "The Land of Heavenly Horses"
01_zhangzhung_missions_task_15_DESC:0 "Our trade connections in the Tarim Basin region speak highly of the horses that are found in the region of [GetProvince('(int32)6736').GetArea.GetName]. Although we could easily prepare claims, some are pressing for restraint, arguing that we are exposing ourselves to unnecessary dangers by capturing another valley. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil13!"

01_zhangzhung_missions_task_16:0 "Dawn of a New Era"
01_zhangzhung_missions_task_16_DESC:0 "A time for celebrating is here! Our wars of conquest, as difficult as they were, are soon to be forgotten, and we must all come together as one people to embrace the future that lies before us. Declare a month-long period of feasting in our new capital city! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@persia_mil5!"

01_zhangzhung_missions_task_17:0 "A Worthy Home"
01_zhangzhung_missions_task_17_DESC:0 "There is no gentle way of saying this; our capital city is pathetic. We must do everything we can to build our people a home that is worthy of their greatness, but this will take time and money. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil8!"

01_zhangzhung_missions_task_18:0 "A Place of Worship"
01_zhangzhung_missions_task_18_DESC:0 "Building a magnificent holy site in our capital city would prove to the world that our Bon faith guides every step of our movements. Let us not forget the faith of our forefathers in these good times, but let us remember how much the gods have bestowed upon us and thank them. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil3!"

01_zhangzhung_missions_task_19:0 "Bread for Everyone"
01_zhangzhung_missions_task_19_DESC:0 "Feeding the empty stomachs of our citizens has always been a difficult task, no doubt due to the lack of suitable land for growing crops. This cannot be an excuse for any longer, however; we must take steps to increase the available foodstuffs available for our people. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil14!"
build_food_tt:0 "We need to build at least 3 #Y Farming Settlments#! in any food producing territories that we own."

01_zhangzhung_missions_task_20:0 "A Mountain Metropolis"
01_zhangzhung_missions_task_20_DESC:0 "Any that follow the trade routes into the elevated regions will soon find their breath taken away; not by the thin mountain air, but by the sight of an impressive metropole nested amongst the craggy heights. How could such a desolate region support such a magnificent city? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil7!"

01_zhangzhung_missions_task_21:0 "The Mountain King"
01_zhangzhung_missions_task_21_DESC:0 "If we are able to conquer all of the regional capitals in the mountains surrounding us, then who will be able to argue with us when we proclaim ourselves to be the Mountain King? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil10!"

01_zhangzhung_missions_task_22:0 "Gathering Under One Tent"
01_zhangzhung_missions_task_22_DESC:0 "Now that we have finally conquered the Tarim Basin, we should do what we can to bring peace to the region; we naturally want all of our subjects, regardless of their religion or culture, to get along with each other. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil13!"

01_zhangzhung_missions_task_23:0 "Plugging the Cracks"
01_zhangzhung_missions_task_23_DESC:0 "We cannot tolerate a porous border, but must take the steps required to secure the mountain passes. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil6!"

01_zhangzhung_missions_task_24:0 "Claiming the Foothills"
01_zhangzhung_missions_task_24_DESC:0 "Believing that our fortunes await us in the exotic and lush lands of the south, we will prepare claims en masse, telling the locals that any territories that lie in the shadows of our mountains naturally belong to us. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@india_mil13!"

01_zhangzhung_missions_task_25:0 "Master of the Horse"
01_zhangzhung_missions_task_25_DESC:0 "Thanks to our control of the horses in the [GetProvince('(int32)6736').GetArea.GetName] Valley, we are able to procure the best warhorses and stallions that can be found in any marketplaces. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@india_mil18!"
