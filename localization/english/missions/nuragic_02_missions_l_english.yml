 nuragic_mission_02_inv:0 "Return of the Sea Peoples"
 nuragic_mission_02_inv_DESCRIPTION:0 "In the libraries and treasuries of the great Kings, one can find strange inscriptions written on steles and clay tablets - baubles and curiosities taken in conquest and soon forgotten. Finding a sage or a scribe to parse these difficult writings would be a tremendous task in this day and age, for there are few who remember the ancient tongues, and even fewer who can understand their archaic syllabary. Thus, as the march of years erodes man's ability to remember his own past, many a wondrous thing is forgotten.\n\nAye, and many a warning, as well."
 nuragic_mission_02_inv_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION:0 "This mission will be completed when we have established a mighty thalassocracy that rules the waters of the Mediterranean unopposed."
