 nuragic_mission_02_inv:0 "Return of the Sea Peoples"
 nuragic_mission_02_inv_DESCRIPTION:0 "In the libraries and treasuries of the great Kings, one can find strange inscriptions written on steles and clay tablets - baubles and curiosities taken in conquest and soon forgotten. Finding a sage or a scribe to parse these difficult writings would be a tremendous task in this day and age, for there are few who remember the ancient tongues, and even fewer who can understand their archaic syllabary. Thus, as the march of years erodes man's ability to remember his own past, many a wondrous thing is forgotten.\n\nAye, and many a warning, as well."
 nuragic_mission_02_inv_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION:0 "This mission will be completed when we have established a mighty thalassocracy that rules the waters of the Mediterranean unopposed."

 #Missions

 nuragic_mission_02_inv_task_1:0 "Expanding the Port District"
 nuragic_mission_02_inv_task_1_DESC:0 "If we want to become known as a naval power, the infrastructure in our cities, especially our main ports, need to be completely overhauled...when compared to our neighbors, we are certainly in a laughable state. By investing in our capital, we will create opportunities for our people to start new lives here. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@persia_mil17!"

 nuragic_mission_02_inv_task_2:0 "Assessing Our Seaworthiness"
 nuragic_mission_02_inv_task_2_DESC:0 "We must take stock of our current military preparedness, in order to see the state that our previous wars have left us in. There is much to be done; considering how much we have come to rely upon our navy, we need to make sure that it is in tip-top shape. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil1!"

 nuragic_mission_02_inv_task_3:0 "[GetProvince('(int32)94').GetName]"
 nuragic_mission_02_inv_task_3_DESC:0 "Now that we have determined to seize all of the major islands in the Mediterranean, pragmatism dictates that we land our forces at [GetProvince('(int32)94').GetName]. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil4!"

 nuragic_mission_02_inv_task_4:0 "Scouting the Shorelines"
 nuragic_mission_02_inv_task_4_DESC:0 "Now that our immediate threats have been dealt with, we finally have a moment to catch our breath and consider other things besides matters of life and death. Perhaps we could send out an exploratory expedition into the waters we are unfamiliar with? Although there will be costs associated with manning the fleet, it will be a good thing for our mapmakers to know the lay of the land around us. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil19!"

 nuragic_mission_02_inv_task_5:0 "Rowing on the Beaches"
 nuragic_mission_02_inv_task_5_DESC:0 "Just because our boatwrights are busy constructing our fleets doesn't mean that we cannot train our sailors - we will set the men up on the beaches and have them practicing rowing. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@egypt_mil10!"

 nuragic_mission_02_inv_task_6:0 "Bronze Measurements"
 nuragic_mission_02_inv_task_6_DESC:0 "In order to handle the volume of business that we are anticipating, we must greatly expand our commercial district. And, knowing how litigous foreign merchants can be, it might be wise to erect some more legal buildings, as well.\n\nWhile we expect a period of chaos during the construction, we will undoubtedly learn new things from the experience. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@event_pic1!"

 nuragic_mission_02_inv_task_7:0 "The Ocean Is Never Satisfied"
 nuragic_mission_02_inv_task_7_DESC:0 "The costs of maintaining a powerful naval fleet are ever-growing, with each new day seemingly bringing another debt that needs to be taken care of. Despite our open pockets, the Ocean is never satisfied by what it is given, and always is hungry for more; we need more sailors, more workers for our ports...oh yes, and we will need to make sure that we have enough cloth for the sails. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@egypt_mil19!"

 nuragic_mission_02_inv_task_8:0 "Empress of the Seas"
 nuragic_mission_02_inv_task_8_DESC:0 "While there are many port cities scattered throughout the waters, there are none that can compare to what we have built; men do not exaggerate when they refer to our capital as the 'Empress of the Seas', for it is from this majestic harbor that we project our power across the entire world. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@event_pic4!"

 nuragic_mission_02_inv_task_9:0 "Slave Markets"
 nuragic_mission_02_inv_task_9_DESC:0 "Whether our reputation has been earned fairly is not for our people to decide; what is true, however, is that all believe us to be raiders and slavers. Our slave ships move quickly upon the waters, following the streams inland until we reach the villages, and then what happens next is between us and the gods. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil15!"

 nuragic_mission_02_inv_task_10:0 "Sinking the Roman Fleet"
 nuragic_mission_02_inv_task_10_DESC:0 "Although we have scrapped many times with the Carthaginians by this point, there remains another nuisance, Rome, that stands in the way of our dreams of expansion. It is true that they are fierce fighters, unmatched on land, but we must shatter their power at sea before we can safely proceed to distant shores. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil11!"

 nuragic_mission_02_inv_task_11:0 "The Hills of Sicania"
 nuragic_mission_02_inv_task_11_DESC:0 "Now that we have our beachhead on the island of Syracuse, it will be a trivial thing to manufacture claims on some of the inland provinces...all we need is the time, of which we have plenty. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil7!"

 nuragic_mission_02_inv_task_12:0 "[GetProvince('(int32)84').GetName] Is the Key"
 nuragic_mission_02_inv_task_12_DESC:0 "We are in complete agreement with our military advisors; if we are able to take control over [GetProvince('(int32)84').GetName], then the rest of the province is sure to quickly succumb to our advances. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil1!"

 nuragic_mission_02_inv_task_13:0 "The Last Scraps"
 nuragic_mission_02_inv_task_13_DESC:0 "Although some might say it is foolish to go to war over such a tiny island, we cannot allow anyone else to be in control of [GetProvince('(int32)1470').GetName]; its strategic location is simply too valuable. From this vantage point, we will be able to raid Carthage with impunity. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil18!"

 nuragic_mission_02_inv_task_14:0 "The Pillars of Hercules"
 nuragic_mission_02_inv_task_14_DESC:0 "Our scouts have returned from the West with fascinating tales of strange peoples and, more importantly, invaluable reconnaisance on the lands they inhabit. Based on these reports, we have reason to believe that our future security depends on our ability to control the gateway to the Ocean, the Pillars of Hercules. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil8! "

 nuragic_mission_02_inv_task_15:0 "As Far As [GetProvince('(int32)2108').GetName]"
 nuragic_mission_02_inv_task_15_DESC:0 "Our sailors are becoming bolder and bolder when it comes to long-distance sailing, exploring the mist-shrouded realms at the very edge of the world and making fast friends in those faraway places. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil6!"

 nuragic_mission_02_inv_task_16:0 "The Socotran Connection"
 nuragic_mission_02_inv_task_16_DESC:0 "An unbelievable story! Years ago, we sent out sailors with the mission to explore faraway lands and report back with what they have found. Although we considered this to be a settled affair, the ships returning to port this morning beg to differ... \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@egypt_mil18!"

 nuragic_mission_02_inv_task_17:0 "The Island At the World's Edge"
 nuragic_mission_02_inv_task_17_DESC:0 "Our friends in [GetProvince('(int32)7530').GetName] have told us of a distant island nation, off of the coast of India, that is welcoming to foreign merchants. While we are unfamiliar with this exotic locale, our knowledgable Greek advisors tell us this land is known as 'Taprobane' and suggest that we send an embassy in order to establish friendly relations. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@india_mil7!"

 nuragic_mission_02_inv_task_18:0 "Collecting the Cyclades"
 nuragic_mission_02_inv_task_18_DESC:0 "It appears that a sizeable band of fighters, enemy soldiers and refugees from [GetProvince('(int32)84').GetArea.GetName] and [GetProvince('(int32)351').GetArea.GetName] have fled to the [GetProvince('(int32)263').GetArea.GetName], hoping to regather their strength in these small islands before attempting to retake their homelands from us. We should put an end to these delusions before more flock to their banners. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil14!"

 nuragic_mission_02_inv_task_19:0 "Subduing the Shekelesh"
 nuragic_mission_02_inv_task_19_DESC:0 "Sicily is a large, mountainous island, filled with a population that resents the ever-growing list of foreign occupiers that covet her bountiful treasures for themselves. Although it will require a noticeable amount of manpower and a years-long effort to clear out the many bandit hideouts and rebel redoubts in the interior, we believe we can bring it fully under our control. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil8!"

 nuragic_mission_02_inv_task_20:0 "Crossing the Mare Ionium"
 nuragic_mission_02_inv_task_20_DESC:0 "Having taken giant steps to secure our possessions in the West, we hungrily set our sights on the rich lands of the East, with the island of Crete being an excellent springboard from which we can raid the entire eastern Mediterranean. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil9!"

 nuragic_mission_02_inv_task_21:0 "Caphtor, Land of the Peleset"
 nuragic_mission_02_inv_task_21_DESC:0 "By now, we have established a rhythm to our operations; after finding a favorable location for our ships to land and our armies we disembark, we make quick work of the native forces before eliminating any lingering pockets of resistance. The archers of Crete, despite their reputation, shouldn't provide our men much trouble.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil6!"

 nuragic_mission_02_inv_task_22:0 "The Island of Roses"
 nuragic_mission_02_inv_task_22_DESC:0 "The reputation of Rhodes certainly precedes it anywhere that ships sail; indeed, the stories of its opulent wealth, noble citizenry and battle-hardened sailors are a point of pride for the citizen of that fair island, who argue convincingly that their city is the most civilized and elegant in all of the world. \n\nYes, yes, all of that is fine, but can they stop us from taking everything for ourselves? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@egypt_mil22!"

 nuragic_mission_02_inv_task_23:0 "Isle of the Denyen"
 nuragic_mission_02_inv_task_23_DESC:0 "At long last, our fleets have sailed throughout the entirety of the Mediterranean, arriving at an island that the locals know as [GetProvince('(int32)330').GetArea.GetName]. How we long to possess this isle! We would have quite the staging ground for raiding the regions of [GetProvince('(int32)1883').GetArea.GetName] and the [GetProvince('(int32)516').GetArea.GetName]. Our fleets sail at dawn for this magnificent prize! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil5!"

 nuragic_mission_02_inv_task_24:0 "Those Learned Greeks"
 nuragic_mission_02_inv_task_24_DESC:0 "There is much for our people to learn from the Greeks, who excel at the arts of rhetoric and oratory and are known as lovers of wisdom. We should encourage their clever to settle amongst our own citizens so that we can study their erudite ways. An expensive undertaking, for sure, but is there a price that one can place on knowledge? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil10!"

 nuragic_mission_02_inv_task_25:0 "The Navel of the World"
 nuragic_mission_02_inv_task_25_DESC:0 "No one can deny that we have caused quite a commotion in the Greek world. Because the powerbrokers of Hellas have expressed an interest in better understanding our people, we have been extended an invitation to visit the Oracle at Delphi, the Pythia, as a goodwill gesture. It is said that the Seeress has the gift of prophecy and can reveal the future...it would certainly be worth considering. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil16!"
