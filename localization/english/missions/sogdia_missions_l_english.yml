 sogdia_missions_task_1:0 "Contact the Steppe Traders"
 sogdia_missions_task_1_DESC:0 "Our lands are considered to be on the border of the civilized realm and the wild unknown, and here we are in the middle of the two. The northern steppes are filled with a variety of nomads, and there are some who will venture to the periphery to barter with the settled peoples. We should reach out and establish trade connections. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@persia_mil6!"

 sogdia_missions_task_2:0 "Our Side of the Jaxartes River"
 sogdia_missions_task_2_DESC:0 "Sakan tribesmen have crossed their side of the Jaxartes River, taking over the lowland plains and even occupying parts of the northern mountain passes. We should consider pushing them back to where they came from... \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@persia_mil20!"

 sogdia_missions_task_3:0 "The Valley Where Two Rivers Meet"
 sogdia_missions_task_3_DESC:0 "We would love nothing more than to extend our dominion into the beautiful [GetProvince('(int32)6704').GetArea.GetName] Valley, but in order to do so, we must first prepare our claims and gather our forces together. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil7!"

But while others simply import these magnificent beasts, we have a long, well-established tradition of training our mounts. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@india_mil18!"

 sogdia_missions_task_9_DESC:0 "Long ago the Sakans used to worship as we do, but they have been wooed by the strange gods of the foreigner and have embraced the Heptadic Pantheon. Now, instead of praying to the Endless Sky, they bow before statues of gold and silver that were crafted by the hands of men. We shall destroy these abominations and cleanse the land from this taint! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil3!"

 sogdia_missions_task_10:0 "Following the Plains West"
 sogdia_missions_task_10_DESC:0 "From our vantage point in the province of [GetProvince('(int32)7251').GetName], where the mountains begin to give way to flat terrain, we can see that the plains of [GetProvince('(int32)7250').GetArea.GetName] would be an excellent place to graze our herds - soon, the time will come to attack the Massagetae again. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil6!"

 sogdia_missions_task_11:0 "Racing the River"
 sogdia_missions_task_11_DESC:0 "Because we have conquered a large swath of flat countryside that runs parallel to the Jaxartes River, some of our boisterous soldiers have been taking advantage of this to secretly race their horses in order to see who is the fastest. Perhaps we should join the troops and see how these games are going? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@persia_mil13!"

 sogdia_missions_task_12:0 "Reaching for the Coast"
 sogdia_missions_task_12_DESC:0 "There is a strange, salty tang in the air, a scent that is unfamiliar to our people and our horses...the locals claim that it originates from a large body of water to the west, known as the Mare Aralense or the Lacus Oxianus depending on who you ask. Desiring access to this wonder for ourselves, we must shatter the waning strength of our enemies and march down to the coasts. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@persia_mil11!"

 sogdia_missions_task_13:0 "Circling the Black Sands"
 sogdia_missions_task_13_DESC:0 "Our forces have conquered the north of the Karakum Desert, bringing us closer to the lands of the renowned Scythian Peoples. Given the sense of urgency that we feel, we should redouble our efforts to build a fortress in the strategic area around [GetProvince('(int32)7260').GetName]; if we have the will to do so, we could construct fortifications in half of the time that it would normally take. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil1!"

 sogdia_missions_task_14:0 "Northern Excursions"
 sogdia_missions_task_14_DESC:0 "The [GetProvince('(int32)6781').GetArea.GetName] region acts as a corridor, funneling invading armies and curious traders that are all seeking that same thing, albeit by different means. Controlling this area, with its access both into our hinterlands and the northern routes to the Ferghana Valley, has become a priority for our nation, but its remoteness will make fabricating claims take time. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@persia_mil14!"

 sogdia_missions_task_15:0 "Lake Issyk-Kul"
 sogdia_missions_task_15_DESC:0 "We find ourselves drawn more and more to the idea of owning the region around Lake Issyk-Kul for a multitude of reasons, with the serenity that the mountain lake provides being high among them. It will also be nice knowing that our borders are secured by only mountain and steppe, with no pockets of resistance to our rule lingering in distant valley settlements. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil9!"

 sogdia_missions_task_19_DESC:0 "Before we move into the heartlands of [GetProvince('(int32)6634').GetArea.GetName], we must take over the land between the mountains - we cannot afford to allow anyone that we do not approve of access into the highlands. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil7!"

 sogdia_missions_task_20:0 "Sogdian Emporiums"
 sogdia_missions_task_20_DESC:0 "Now that we have secured the northern passage that is so vital to the trade routes, offering safe roads from the Mare Aralense to Lake Issyk-Kul, we can begin to construct impressive marketplaces in true Sogdian style. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@egypt_mil19!"

 sogdia_missions_task_21_DESC:0 "[GetProvince('(int32)7270').GetName] is known for the type of camel that lives in the region, as they can be often be found wandering through the dusty plains near the river. With some effort, we could take what Nature has given to us so freely and really make something out of the area. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@egypt_mil8!"

 sogdia_missions_task_25_DESC:0 "In Achaemenid times, our lands and those of the Bactrians were governed by the same satrap and our countrymen freely traveled across the borders. Because of this, our people have a fondness for the area to the south, particularly the city of [GetProvince('(int32)6682').GetName]. Some even say the gateway to [GetProvince('(int32)6682').GetArea.GetName] would be better administered by a Sogdian King than a Bactrian governor. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@persia_mil8!"

 sogdia_missions_task_26_DESC:0 "Although fighting the Bactrians was no easy task, we were able to reclaim the provinces that literally carry the names of our forefathers, of our people - we must move down from the city in the mountains and take our rightful place in Marakanda. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@persia_mil7!"

 sogdia_missions_task_28:0 "A Triumph for Three Cities"
 sogdia_missions_task_28_DESC:0 "Because [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has led us to stunning victory after victory over our enemies, seizing the mightiest citadels in the region with an ease that belies the difficulty, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetSheHe] has become known as the 'Besieger', a name that is most assuredly deserved. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil15!"

 sogdia_missions_task_29:0 "Horse Breeders"
 sogdia_missions_task_29_DESC:0 "Some of our finest horse breeders have approached us privately, asking us to fund a farm for raising stallions out in the province of [GetProvince('(int32)7261').GetName].

 sogdia_missions_task_30_DESC:0 "The endless plains of the [GetProvince('(int32)7254').GetArea.GetName] are excellent lands for livestock animals; not only can we graze our herds here, but there are wild animals to catch and places where packs of horses roam freely...we have done well by acquiring these territories. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@persia_mil19!"
