 #Missions
 armazic_missions_task_1:0 "Surrounded by Enemies"
 armazic_missions_task_1_DESC:0 "We are surrounded by enemies on all sides; the grim Armenians to the south, arrogant Colchis to our west and the wild Albanians to the east. Because our military advisors cannot come to a consensus, we will fabricate claims on everyone around us. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil6!"
 armazic_missions_task_2:0 "The Push for the Coasts"
 armazic_missions_task_2_DESC:0 "Our recent victories come with the tantalizing promise of even greater rewards in the days ahead; if our soldiers continue to push onward, we will not only reach the shores of the Mare Hyrcanum, but we could even gain access to the waters of Pontus Euxinus. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil18!"
 armazic_missions_task_3:0 "Land of the Fleece"
 armazic_missions_task_3_DESC:0 "Even though we have shattered the might of [GetProvince('(int32)1715').GetArea.GetName], there are still fears that they could return to a position of strength. It has become clear that we must utterly eradicate them, in order to prevent this possibility from ever happening. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil14!"
 armazic_missions_task_4:0 "Albanian Scraps"
 armazic_missions_task_4_DESC:0 "Our forces continue to destroy the Albanian tribesmen; now that we are firmly in control of their heartlands, it won't be long before we finish eating up the rest of the scraps of their kingdom. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil6!"
 armazic_missions_task_5:0 "Getting Our Feet Wet"
 armazic_missions_task_5_DESC:0 "Although we are new powerbrokers in the region, our presence in the Pontus Euxinus will soon be made known to all - our shipbuilding initiative will expand our influence far from the shores of our homeland! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil4!"
 armazic_missions_task_6:0 "Empower the Eristavi"
 armazic_missions_task_6_DESC:0 "The Eristavi were a ennobled class of local rulers, with responsibilities similar to those of a governor, and were entrusted by the Pharnavazids with ruling over provinces in their name. Before we can enact any further reforms, we must grant them authority. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil3!"
 armazic_missions_task_7:0 "A Unique Language"
 armazic_missions_task_7_DESC:0 "Although a large number of tongues are currently spoken in our homeland, with an equal number of written scripts being utilized by the people, we have decided that everyone must speak the same dialect and write in the same manner. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@india_mil17!"
 armazic_missions_task_8:0 "Baiberdon"
 armazic_missions_task_8_DESC:0 "[GetProvince('(int32)1760').GetName], an important city in Armenia Superioris, is undefended, its walls being guarded by the reputation of the Armenian army alone. If we prepare our claims now and strike quickly, we believe that the entire province could fall to our soldiers. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil8!"
 armazic_missions_task_9:0 "From Lake Lychnitis"
 armazic_missions_task_9_DESC:0 "It is only a few day's ride to the capital of the Armenians from the newly-conquered city of [GetProvince('(int32)1572').GetName], and although they will resist our forces with everything they have, we must strike at the heart of their kingdom. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil15!"
 armazic_missions_task_10:0 "Armenian Fortifications"
 armazic_missions_task_10_DESC:0 "Because we have taken so many of the great cities of Armenia for ourselves, we are privy to vast stores of knowledge that we did not have access to before. Everyone knows that the Armenians build masterful fortifications, so why don't we teach our own engineers how to mimic their style? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil1!"
 armazic_missions_task_11:0 "A Line of Kings"
 armazic_missions_task_11_DESC:0 "Because of the reforms ushered in by the Pharnavazid Dynasty, the glory of our people has been secured for generations, and from our fortress at [GetProvince('(int32)1676').GetName] we reign over an expansive kingdom. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil10!"
 armazic_missions_task_12:0 "Armazic Union"
 armazic_missions_task_12_DESC:0 "For the first time in the history of our people, the adherents of the Armazic Faith have been united under one crown, with the power of our neighboring enemies destroyed for a generation or more. May Armazi continue to pour his blessing upon us and lead us towards victory! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil3!"
