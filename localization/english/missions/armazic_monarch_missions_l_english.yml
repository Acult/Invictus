 #Missions
 armazic_missions_task_1:0 "Surrounded by Enemies"
 armazic_missions_task_1_DESC:0 "We are surrounded by enemies on all sides; the grim Armenians to the south, arrogant Colchis to our west and the wild Albanians to the east. Because our military advisors cannot come to a consensus, we will fabricate claims on everyone around us. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil6!"
 armazic_missions_task_2:0 "The Push for the Coasts"
 armazic_missions_task_2_DESC:0 "Our recent victories come with the tantalizing promise of even greater rewards in the days ahead; if our soldiers continue to push onward, we will not only reach the shores of the Mare Hyrcanum, but we could even gain access to the waters of Pontus Euxinus. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil18!"
 armazic_missions_task_3:0 "Land of the Fleece"
 armazic_missions_task_3_DESC:0 "Even though we have shattered the might of [GetProvince('(int32)1715').GetArea.GetName], there are still fears that they could return to a position of strength. It has become clear that we must utterly eradicate them, in order to prevent this possibility from ever happening. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil14!"
 armazic_missions_task_4:0 "Albanian Scraps"
 armazic_missions_task_4_DESC:0 "Help"
 armazic_missions_task_5:0 "Getting Our Feet Wet"
 armazic_missions_task_5_DESC:0 "Although we are new powerbrokers in the region, our presence in the Pontus Euxinus will soon be made known to all - our shipbuilding initiative will expand our influence far from the shores of our homeland! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil4!"

 armazic_missions_task_8:0 "Baiberdon"
 armazic_missions_task_8_DESC:0 "[GetProvince('(int32)1760').GetName], an important city in Armenia Superioris, is undefended, its walls being guarded by the reputation of the Armenian army alone. If we prepare our claims now and strike quickly, we believe that the entire province could fall to our soldiers. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil8!"
 armazic_missions_task_9:0 "From Lake Lychnitis"
 armazic_missions_task_9_DESC:0 "It is only a few day's ride to the capital of the Armenians from the newly-conquered city of [GetProvince('(int32)1572').GetName], and although they will resist our forces with everything they have, we must strike at the heart of their kingdom. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil15!"
 armazic_missions_task_10:0 "Armenian Fortifications"
 armazic_missions_task_10_DESC:0 "Because we have taken so many of the great cities of Armenia for ourselves, we are privy to vast stores of knowledge that we did not have access to before. Everyone knows that the Armenians build masterful fortifications, so why don't we teach our own engineers how to mimic their style? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil1!"
