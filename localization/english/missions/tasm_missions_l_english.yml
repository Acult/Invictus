01_tasm_missions_task_1_DESC: "If we are to set our plans for expansion into motion, then we must gather forth every available soldier and train them for the dark days ahead. Send out the call to our fighting forces and tell them to prepare for a brutal war in the desert. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@persia_mil1!"

01_tasm_missions_task_2: "The Northern Passage"
01_tasm_missions_task_2_DESC: "Although it will take time and resources, we could gather some tribesmen and have them inhabit the northern passages that are now only frequented by caravans and bandits. Because we do not have many people that are willing to move, we will have to use some of our soldiers instead. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@egypt_mil3!"

01_tasm_missions_task_3: "Conflict with Gerrha"
01_tasm_missions_task_3_DESC: "We desire access to the waters of the #E Sinus Persicus#! for ourselves, and yet there lies a problem; the Gerrhan armies that are quickly noticing our growth are in our way. Our mutual interest in the province of #E Ukrush#! will undoubtedly lead to conflict between our great peoples. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@egypt_mil4!"

01_tasm_missions_task_4: "Seizing Shammar"
01_tasm_missions_task_4_DESC: "Although we have taken strides in securing the province of #E Shammar#! for ourselves, we will have to fight the Qedarites if we want to wrest control of the doorway to the oases from them. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@egypt_mil5!"

01_tasm_missions_task_5: "The Jadis Are With Us"
01_tasm_missions_task_5_DESC: "For centuries, our tribes and those of our close cousins #E Jadis#! to the south have wandered freely amongst the lands that belong to each other, with no real distinction being made between our people - but the time has come to change this loose arrangement. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@persia_mil12!"

01_tasm_missions_task_6: "The Cities Of The Coasts"
01_tasm_missions_task_6_DESC: "The fierceness of our previous conflicts with the Gerrhan hordes has done nothing besides harden the resolve of our soldiers to evict them from their homes - a new future awaits us, one where the cities of our enemies become the homes of our friends. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil18!"

01_tasm_missions_task_7: "A Cause For Celebration"
01_tasm_missions_task_7_DESC: "Our enemies continue to smash foes that never would have foreseen their doom at our hands, and the reputation of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] soldier continues to grow. Because of this fearsome reputation, morale in our armies have never been higher. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@persia_mil16!"

01_tasm_missions_task_8: "Expanding Towards The Sea"
01_tasm_missions_task_8_DESC: "We must not cease our warmongering, but should ride our momentum until all of our smaller enemies have been subdued. The rich cities of the coastal trade routes grow frightened at our advance, hoping that they will be able to withstand our sieges - let us show them that there is no safety in this world. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@egypt_mil7!"

01_tasm_missions_task_9: "A New Capital"
01_tasm_missions_task_9_DESC: "For the first time in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] history, we have conquered cities that lie close to bodies of water - a doorway to a wider world that we currently know nothing about. It has been proposed that we move our capital to one of these ancient cities in order to take advantage of the connection to the sea, but there are loud objections. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil11!"

01_tasm_missions_task_10: "Masters of Trade"
01_tasm_missions_task_10_DESC: "The surplus of luxury goods that we have stored in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] has led our capital to acquiring a reputation for having the best markets in all of #E Arabia#! - we are the acknowledged Masters of Trade of the entire peninsula. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@egypt_mil16!"

01_tasm_missions_task_12: "The Fortress of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] Culture"
01_tasm_missions_task_12_DESC: "Even as our destiny calls us towards lands unknown to our forefathers, the provinces of #E Yamama#! and #E Shammar#! shall always remain the bastions of our culture, the fortress where the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] people can be safe. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@persia_mil7!"

01_tasm_missions_task_13: "The Western Fleet"
01_tasm_missions_task_13_DESC: "Although it will be expensive and will require the concerted effort of a great deal of laborers, we can give the order that a massive armada be constructed in the #E Sinus Arabicus#! in order to protect our rights in the waters. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil19!"

01_tasm_missions_task_16: "A Matter Of Life And Death"
01_tasm_missions_task_16_DESC: "The fierceness of our conflict with the armies of #E Gerrha#! have convinced us of the need to utterly destroy their kingdom, and what is more, we must deny them their ancestral lands by claiming them for ourselves. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil15!"

01_tasm_missions_task_18: "East Omana"
01_tasm_missions_task_18_DESC: "While we are not threatened by the #E Samad#! tribes that live on the hinterlands of our country, we do not want to allow a lawless environment to thrive near our borders, so we are thus obligated to conquer these distant tribesmen. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@persia_mil9!"

01_tasm_missions_task_19: "The Hills of Asir"
01_tasm_missions_task_19_DESC: "The dusty slopes and endless dunes that we are used to are giving way to harder, rockier ground - lands that are inhabited by a fierce people that will contest our presence in the region. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@persia_mil20!"

01_tasm_missions_task_20: "Victory in #E Qedar#!"
01_tasm_missions_task_20_DESC: "Our ownership of the province of #E Qedar#! afford us the ability to raid into the #E Levant#! as well as #E Mesopotamia#! if we so chose; how fortunate we are, to be the undisputed masters of such vital routes through the desert.

01_tasm_missions_task_21_DESC: "The strategic territory of [GetProvince('(int32)8816').GetName] is centered on the crossroads to the north of us; a gateway to the regions beyond, and a backdoor into our territories that must be fortified at all costs. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@egypt_mil23!"

01_tasm_missions_task_22: "The Eastern Fleet"
01_tasm_missions_task_22_DESC: "There are many well-established nations that ply the waters of the #E Sinus Persicus#!, and we should be careful about entering this crowded arena - we must construct a navy to guard our shores, as well as keep our enemies from landing their forces on our beaches. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@event_pic4!"

01_tasm_missions_task_24_DESC: "From the highest points in the mountains, we can see the glistening waters of the #E Sinus Arabicus#! just out of reach.
