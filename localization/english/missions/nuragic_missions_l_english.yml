 nuragic_mission_inv:0 "Nuragic Homeland"
 nuragic_mission_inv_DESCRIPTION:0 "For as long as the sun has traversed its path in the celestial realms, our people have lived simple and uneventful lives, our fortunes ebbing and flowing like the ocean waters that surround us. While some sneer at our ways and call us barbarians, we were content with what we had to call our own.\n\nThis has changed with the arrival of the Carthaginians, who have seized the southern coast of our island for themselves. Their diplomats have made it abundantly clear that our mountainous homelands are not safe from their encroaching armies, but we have a different idea about our future."
 nuragic_mission_inv_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION:0 "This mission will be considered complete when we have pushed the foreigners from our island and reclaimed it for ourselves."

 # Mission Tasks
 ####################


 nuragic_mission_inv_1_task:0 "Gathering the Tribal Elders"
 nuragic_mission_inv_1_task_DESC:0 "Before we make any moves against the foreigners, we must first gather a consensus amongst our tribal brethren. We cannot do this alone; we will need to unite our strength if we have any hope of succeeding. Send word to the neighboring tribes that a Council will be held! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil3!"
 nuragic_mission_inv_2_task:0 "Securing the Reserves"
 nuragic_mission_inv_2_task_DESC:0 "If we have any hopes of winning in the field, our soldiers must be well-fed and ready to fight at any time, for hunger is any ever-present enemy that is difficult to escape. As soon as we have the funds available to us, we should build a farming settlement, as well as import as much grain as we can store. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil14!"
 nuragic_mission_inv_3_task:0 "Restore the Nuraghe"
 nuragic_mission_inv_3_task_DESC:0 "In times of trouble, our ancestors retreated to the tower fortifications they erected, the nuraghe, waiting for opportune times to strike at their foes from these positions of strength. Before we wage our own wars, we must honor the ancient ways and make sure the nuraghe are fortified, as well as properly stocked with provisions. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil8!"
 nuragic_mission_inv_4_task:0 "The First City to Fall"
 nuragic_mission_inv_4_task_DESC:0 "There is a city in the north that the Carthaginians have named [GetProvince('(int32)3504').GetName] that is relatively isolated...this shall be the first to fall to our armies. Having no cities of our own, we hope to use Olbia Rasna as a base of operations moving forward, so it is of vital importance that we develop the infrastructure there. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@event_pic4!"
 nuragic_mission_inv_5_task:0 "Locking the Back Door"
 nuragic_mission_inv_5_task_DESC:0 "The ease of the crossing at [GetProvince('(int32)3506').GetName] is known to everyone; it is a trivial thing for an army from Corsica to sail across the waters, and because we are loathe to allow anyone such easy access to our island, we must take measures to prevent this from ever happening. But first, we must expel the Corsians who are currently on our island first... \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil1!"
 nuragic_mission_inv_6_task:0 "A Foothold in Phikaria"
 nuragic_mission_inv_6_task_DESC:0 "Dreams of foreign conquest are the last thing that we wish to entangle ourselves with, but all can see the prudence of securing the port of [GetProvince('(int32)3508').GetName] for our own purposes. Besides, we have no desire to see the Corsians prosper, especially at our expense.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@egypt_mil6!"
 nuragic_mission_inv_7_task:0 "Eyes On the Hills"
 nuragic_mission_inv_7_task_DESC:0 "One clear advantage that we have over the foreigners is that we know these lands well, whereas they are mere trespassers. We can use our knowledge of the terrain to our advantage, sending our scouts through difficult country to keep an eye on their troop movements. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil7!"
 nuragic_mission_inv_8_task:0 "Sacrifice to the Gods of War"
 nuragic_mission_inv_8_task_DESC:0 "There are arcane ways known to our shamans wherein our victories over our enemies are all but assured...the price asked by the gods of death is steep, however; they are only satisfied with blood. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil15!"
 nuragic_mission_inv_9_task:0 "The Port of [GetProvince('(int32)3494').GetName]"
 nuragic_mission_inv_9_task_DESC:0 "Although the land itself is relatively undeveloped thus far, the Carthaginians consider the port of [GetProvince('(int32)3494').GetName] to be vital to their resupplying efforts, and because of this, we cannot allow them to control this location any longer. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil4!"
 nuragic_mission_inv_10_task:0 "The Sacking of [GetProvince('(int32)3481').GetName]"
 nuragic_mission_inv_10_task_DESC:0 "Like animals in a blood frenzy, our soldiers, bolstered by their recent successes in the field, can sense the doom of the invaders and demand that we press onward to [GetProvince('(int32)3481').GetName], undoubtedly desirous of the rich treasures that are purported to be held within its walls. Our men will settle for nothing less than the complete destruction of the city. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil15!"
 nuragic_mission_inv_11_task:0 "Karalian Farmlands"
 nuragic_mission_inv_11_task_DESC:0 "Truly, we have seen few places like [GetProvince('(int32)3484').GetName]; a city surrounded by fertile vineyards, kissed by the sun and where true happiness surely lives. All who pass by this city desire an end to their travels, longing to stay on our estates and watch the dolphins play in waters of the Mare Tyrrhenum. We shall cultivate Karali, building it into a magnificent city regardless of the cost. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil16!"
 nuragic_mission_inv_12_task:0 "A Southern Capital"
 nuragic_mission_inv_12_task_DESC:0 "Having become the undisputed masters of our island, with our authority being acknowledged from the northern redoubts to the southernmost cities - indeed, the entirety of Sardinia is ours - it is safe to say that a new era has dawned, one where the Nuragic people will have a homeland of their own. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil19!"
 nuragic_mission_inv_13_task:0 "Seize the Ships"
 nuragic_mission_inv_13_task_DESC:0 "Now that we have managed to secure a port city for ourselves, we should consider constructing a fleet immediately. Luckily for us, in their haste to vacate the region, the enemy abandoned a few ships that are in decent condition; it wouldn't take much to get them back in working order. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@egypt_mil21!"
 nuragic_mission_inv_14_task:0 "A Blind Eye to Piracy"
 nuragic_mission_inv_14_task_DESC:0 "Although it has been many years since we have been in contact with our cousins, we have fond memories of the dread Pirates of Mago...perhaps they would like to come visit for a while? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@egypt_mil24!"

 me_nuragic_1_title:0 "A Council of Great Importance"
 me_nuragic_1_desc:0 "[SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] bursts out of the tent, a filthy stream of curses erupting from [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] mouth, and moments later is joined by [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] entire entourage. All that are standing outside - not an insignificant number, as a large number of soldiers have been milling about all morning - can thus see for themselves how the negotiations are going. A quiet murmuring ripples through the gathering crowd as [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] turns to address them, face flushed with rage.\n\n'A few weeks ago, I, [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], sent word to the Tribal Elders, seeking an audience to discuss the danger the Carthaginians pose to us all, and yet no one had to decency to answer the call save the Tibulatians, who are foreigners on this island as much as the North Africans are. I expected our cousins to answer the sacred call, considering that we have many Nuragic tribes on this island, but I shouldn't be surprised that they all slink away from a war council.' Turning towards a red-faced [GetCountry('X47').GetRuler.GetName], who is standing with arms crossed, [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] extends [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] finger and continues [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] tirade, [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] voice trembling in anger.\n\n'I believe that you are all cowards, unworthy to sleep with pigs! [GetCountry('X47').GetRuler.GetFirstName], you dare to come here with honeyed words promising a false peace, your breath sweetened by Carthaginian wine and your pockets flush with their silver - enough! You are no partner in war, but a serpent in the grass. Leave at once, lest I break my oath of hospitality and strike you down where you stand!' The mood in the throng turns ugly as [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] screams 'There shall be no mercy shown to anyone! Sardinia will be ours!'"
