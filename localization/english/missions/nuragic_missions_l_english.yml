 nuragic_mission_inv:0 "Nuragic Homeland"
 nuragic_mission_inv_DESCRIPTION:0 "For as long as the sun has traversed its path in the celestial realms, our people have lived simple and uneventful lives, our fortunes ebbing and flowing like the ocean waters that surround us. While some sneer at our ways and call us barbarians, we were content with what we had to call our own.\n\nThis has changed with the arrival of the Carthaginians, who have seized the southern coast of our island for themselves. Their diplomats have made it abundantly clear that our mountainous homelands are not safe from their encroaching armies, but we have a different idea about our future."
 nuragic_mission_inv_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION:0 "This mission will be considered complete when we have pushed the foreigners from our island and reclaimed it for ourselves."
 nuragic_mission_inv_BUTTON_TOOLTIP:0 "test"

 nuragic_mission_inv_1_task:0 "Gathering the Tribal Elders"
 nuragic_mission_inv_1_task_DESC:0 "Before we make any moves against the foreigners, we must first gather a consensus amongst our tribal brethren. We cannot do this alone; we will need to unite our strength if we have any hope of succeeding. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil3!"
 nuragic_mission_inv_2_task:0 "Securing the Reserves"
 nuragic_mission_inv_2_task_DESC:0 "If we have any hopes of winning in the field, our soldiers must be well-fed and ready to fight at any time, for hunger is any ever-present enemy that is difficult to escape. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil2!"
 nuragic_mission_inv_3_task:0 "Restore the Nuraghe"
 nuragic_mission_inv_3_task_DESC:0 "In times of trouble, our ancestors retreated to the tower fortifications they erected, the nuraghe, waiting for opportune times to strike at their foes from these positions of strength. Before we wage our own wars, we must honor the ancient ways and make sure the nuraghe are fortified. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil8!"
 nuragic_mission_inv_4_task:0 "The First City to Fall"
 nuragic_mission_inv_4_task_DESC:0 "There is a city in the north that the Carthaginians have named [GetProvince('(int32)3504').GetName] that is relatively isolated...this shall be the first to fall to our armies. Having no cities of our own, we hope to use Olbia Rasna as a base of operations moving forward, so it is vital that we are able to take it. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@event_pic4!"
 nuragic_mission_inv_5_task:0 "Locking the Back Door"
 nuragic_mission_inv_5_task_DESC:0 "The ease of the crossing at [GetProvince('(int32)3506').GetName] is known to everyone; it is a trivial thing for an army from Corsica to sail across the waters, and because we are loathe to allow anyone such easy access to our island, we must take measures to prevent this from ever happening. But first, we must expel the Corsians who are currently there... \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil1!"
 nuragic_mission_inv_6_task:0 "A Foothold in Phikaria"
 nuragic_mission_inv_6_task_DESC:0 "Dreams of foreign conquest are the last thing that we wish to entangle ourselves with, but all can see the prudence of securing the port of [GetProvince('(int32)3508').GetName] for our own purposes. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@egypt_mil6!"
 nuragic_mission_inv_7_task:0 "Eyes On the Hills"
 nuragic_mission_inv_7_task_DESC:0 "One clear advantage that we have over the foreigners is that we know these lands well, whereas they are mere trespassers. We can use our knowledge of the terrain to our advantage, sending our scouts through difficult country to keep an eye on their troop movements. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil7!"
 nuragic_mission_inv_8_task:0 "Sacrifice to the Gods of Death"
 nuragic_mission_inv_8_task_DESC:0 "There are arcane ways known to our shamans wherein our victories over our enemies are all but assured...the price asked by the gods of death is steep, however; they are only satisfied with blood. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil15!"
 nuragic_mission_inv_9_task:0 "The Port of [GetProvince('(int32)3494').GetName]"
 nuragic_mission_inv_9_task_DESC:0 "Although the land itself is relatively undeveloped thus far, the Carthaginians consider the port of [GetProvince('(int32)3494').GetName] to be vital to their resupplying efforts, and because of this, we cannot allow them to control this location any longer. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil4!"
 nuragic_mission_inv_10_task:0 "The Sacking of [GetProvince('(int32)3481').GetName]"
 nuragic_mission_inv_10_task_DESC:0 "Like animals in a blood frenzy, our soldiers, bolstered by their recent successes in the field, can sense the doom of the invaders and demand that we press onward to [GetProvince('(int32)3481').GetName], undoubtedly desirous of the rich treasures that are purported to be held within its walls. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil15!"
 nuragic_mission_inv_11_task:0 "The Farmlands of Karali"
 nuragic_mission_inv_11_task_DESC:0 "Truly, we have seen few places like [GetProvince('(int32)3484').GetName]; a city surrounded by fertile vineyards, kissed by the sun and where true happiness surely lives. We must have this city for our own, no matter what the cost might be! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil16!"
 nuragic_mission_inv_12_task:0 "A Southern Capital"
 nuragic_mission_inv_12_task_DESC:0 "Having become the undisputed masters of our island, with our authority being acknowledged from the northern redoubts to the southernmost cities - indeed, the entirety of Sardinia is ours - it is safe to say that a new era has dawned, one where the Nuragic people will have a homeland of their own. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil19!"
