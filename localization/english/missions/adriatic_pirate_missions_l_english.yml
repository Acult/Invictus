01_adriatic_pirate_missions: "Scourge of the Mare Adriaticum"
01_adriatic_pirate_missions_DESCRIPTION: "It is a great mystery as to why so many foreign ships, their cargo holds packed to bursting with all manner of trade goods, suddenly disappear when they sail through the bright blue waters of the Mare Adriaticum. Naturally, the Illyrian tribes, who are oftentimes accused of being no better than robbers and brigands, know nothing about the matter when asked.\n\nGiven its reputation as a wild, ungovernable region, Illyria is the perfect place for the marauding pirate fleets to hide..."
01_adriatic_pirate_missions_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION: "This mission will be completed when we establish a dread #Y Pirate Kingdom#! in Illyria and use the resources of our country to attack the major trade routes."
01_adriatic_pirate_missions_BUTTON_TOOLTIP: "Soon, we shall claim the Mare Adriaticum as our sea!"

#Missions

01_adriatic_pirate_missions_task_1: "Welcoming With Silver"
01_adriatic_pirate_missions_task_1_DESC: "For as long as any can remember, piracy has been a way of life in #E Illyria#!; our rugged coastline has many places where one can hide a small fleet. Instead of skulking in the shadows like common criminals, we should secretly invite the pirates to settle in our ports, but we will need the infrastructure to accomodate them - as well as coins; lots and lots of silver coins. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@egypt_mil19!"

01_adriatic_pirate_missions_task_2: "Raiding For Slaves"
01_adriatic_pirate_missions_task_2_DESC: "By assembling a vast flotilla, we can raid the lands of our neighbors and hold our own if it comes to a fight; let the Italians, the Etruscans, the Greeks and the Egyptians all fear our Illyrian slavers! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil15!"

01_adriatic_pirate_missions_task_3: "Pirate Shipyards"
01_adriatic_pirate_missions_task_3_DESC: "Our new sea-raiding houseguests are finding their arrangements satisfactory, but have requested permission to build their own port and shipyard in one of our provinces. If we are able to provide the raw materials and the know-how, they will fund the construction; an offer that we are only too happy to accept. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@egypt_mil6!"

01_adriatic_pirate_missions_task_4: "Our Fates Are One"
01_adriatic_pirate_missions_task_4_DESC: "Although we have a reputation for turning a blind eye to pirate ships in our harbors, we have not officially acknowledged their presence - a pretense that [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has demanded that we set aside. Although some are resisting their corrupting influence, there are calls in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital] to openly embrace the pirate's way of life. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil18!"

01_adriatic_pirate_missions_task_5: "A Sailor's Rations"
01_adriatic_pirate_missions_task_5_DESC: "By properly taking care of our sailors, ensuring that they have good provisions when they embark on their raids, they will be able to sail farther away and for longer periods of time. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil14!"

01_adriatic_pirate_missions_task_6: "The West Is Ours"
01_adriatic_pirate_missions_task_6_DESC: "The heavily-traveled trade routes near the #E Straight of Messene#! are calling out to us like the fabled sirens, but there are enemy countries that resent our ascendance and will try to stunt our growth if they can. If push comes to shove, we might have to defeat the strongest naval power in the Mediterranean so that all will understand that the West is ours! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@egypt_mil12!"

01_adriatic_pirate_missions_task_7: "Claiming Our Sea"
01_adriatic_pirate_missions_task_7_DESC: "Controlling the strategic territories of #E Orikon#! and #E Hydrous#! will allow us to monitor the traffic that sails in and out of the Mare Adriaticum - the last step we need before we can truly claim that the body of water is, in fact, Our Sea. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil19!"

01_adriatic_pirate_missions_task_8: "Stealing The Scythe"
01_adriatic_pirate_missions_task_8_DESC: "The value of owning the fortress island of #E Korkyra#! speaks for itself; not only must we have it, but we must deny our enemies its valuable location. If the isle falls to our fleets, we will have the perfect staging point to raid the entirety of #E Greece#!. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil1!"

01_adriatic_pirate_missions_task_9: "Epirote Raiders"
01_adriatic_pirate_missions_task_9_DESC: "Now that #E Korkyra#! belongs to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], we can take the steps necessary to make it the perfect pirate haven; the waters of Sinus Corinthus will be a highway that our sailors follow, straight into the heart of fortune! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil16!"

01_adriatic_pirate_missions_task_10: "Calling All Pirates"
01_adriatic_pirate_missions_task_10_DESC: "Now that we have decided to openly throw in our lot with the pirates, we must send a message far and wide, to every port city from the Straights of Gibraltar to the distant islands of India; there is amnesty for you in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], my misunderstood friend, for we have need of your expertise. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil13!"

01_adriatic_pirate_missions_task_11: "The Port of Hydrous"
01_adriatic_pirate_missions_task_11_DESC: "There is a pirate haven in #E Hydrous#!, as everyone from the region is aware, and representatives from the province have secretly asked us to liberate them from their tyrannical overlords - tell our levies and fleets that we sail for the heel of Italia. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil10!"

01_adriatic_pirate_missions_task_12: "Seizing Meligounis"
01_adriatic_pirate_missions_task_12_DESC: "The tiny, backwater island of #E Meligounis#! to the north of Sicily would be the perfect location for a pirate base - we would be able to launch our slave ships towards the wealthy lands of Africa and Italia without having to return home to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName]. What are we waiting for, then? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@event_pic13!"

01_adriatic_pirate_missions_task_13: "Choking The Strait"
01_adriatic_pirate_missions_task_13_DESC: "Let us repeat the formula that we have perfected in #E Korkyra#! on our newest possession, #E Meligounis#!; we will build a fortified port that will become the latest pirate haven in the Mare Tyrrenum. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil8!"

01_adriatic_pirate_missions_task_14: "Libernian Liburnians"
01_adriatic_pirate_missions_task_14_DESC: "Although our ships are currently fine - we have no complaints, truly - it has been suggested that we could slightly modify our designs to incorporate some improvements. We should look into this, to see if it is actually possible, and if it is, then we should do it. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@egypt_mil22!"

01_adriatic_pirate_missions_task_15: "The Pirate's Crown"
01_adriatic_pirate_missions_task_15_DESC: "It has been said that 'every King needs a crown', and the time has come for [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] to accept the accolades that our people keep thrusting upon [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHim]. Is there a better way to celebrate our success in choking the Straights of Messene than having a coronation? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil10!"

01_adriatic_pirate_missions_task_16: "Fearsomely Arrayed"
01_adriatic_pirate_missions_task_16_DESC: "Although we have rightfully focused our attention on outfitting our navy, there are many local innovations that could be applied to our armies. Now that we are in the position to do something about it, we should upgrade our soldier's fighting kit. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil1!"

01_adriatic_pirate_missions_task_17: "Pirate Illyria"
01_adriatic_pirate_missions_task_17_DESC: "We have certainly come a long way from where we started; indeed, from our current vantage point, our recent past is almost unrecognizable to us. 'Pirate Illyria' is a term that was once thrown about as an insult, but we have turned the name into something that men and even the gods fear. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil4!"

01_adriatic_pirate_missions_task_18_DESC: "After careful consideration, it has been decided that we must take #E Rhodes#! for ourselves - we cannot allow anyone else control of the strategic harbor at the Isle of Roses. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil6!"

01_adriatic_pirate_missions_task_19: "A Beautiful Port for Pirates"
01_adriatic_pirate_missions_task_19_DESC: "Now that the beautiful island of #E Rhodes#! belongs to us, it is high time that we begin the process of building it up into a true pirate city. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil8!"
