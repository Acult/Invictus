 crete_mission_inv:0 "The Unification of Crete"
 crete_mission_inv_DESCRIPTION:0 "War! Its unmistakeable black hand has tainted everything around us; everywhere one goes to these days, whether it be the agora, the temple or the tavern, there is nothing but war and devastation. The Macedonians, led by Alexander and his Successors, have now brought war to the wider world, but the city states on the island of Crete have somehow managed to avoid being entangled in the madness. And yet, a new generation of ambitious men have forsaken the dangers that their fathers desperately warned them about, and seek the dominate the island by force, upsetting the precarious status quo. \n\nThe poets, lost in their reveries, sigh deeply into their verses and their cups, proclaiming that all that is good must come to an end...\n\nFor now war has found Crete."
 crete_mission_inv_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION:0 "This mission will be considered complete when Crete has been unified into a single state."

 # Mission Tasks
 ####################


 crete_mission_inv_1_task:0 "Discipline in the Camps"
 crete_mission_inv_1_task_DESC:0 "If we thinking about conquering the entirety of Crete for ourselves, we are going to need a disciplined, professional army - one that is very different looking than the one we currently possess. It might not be popular news with the rank and file, but tell the soldiers that it's time to drill! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil17!"
 crete_mission_inv_2_task:0 "Iron Weapons"
 crete_mission_inv_2_task_DESC:0 "We must properly equip our soldiers with the best military equipment that we can afford, for we can ill-afford to send men into the field against a foe with superior kit. The treasuries of the Cretan city-states are deep, and yet ours must be deeper still. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@egypt_mil19!"
 crete_mission_inv_3_task:0 "An Unruly State of Affairs"
 crete_mission_inv_3_task_DESC:0 "For far too long, Crete has existed in a state of near-paralysis, with every man acting in his own interest. As a ship must only have one captain, so, too, must our island only have one master! Prepare our claims and gather our levies, for war is on the horizon! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil5!"
 crete_mission_inv_4_task:0 "Siegeworks and Sappers"
 crete_mission_inv_4_task_DESC:0 "The chaotic political state of our island, with no clear hegemon exerting their authority over the numerous city-states, has resulted in a situation where nearly every province is fortified. Our soldiers, especially those operating our siege engines, have their work cut out for them.\n\nIt goes without saying that maintaing such an elite military unit has its associated costs...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil1!"
 crete_mission_inv_5_task:0 "A Gold Coin to the First Man"
 crete_mission_inv_5_task_DESC:0 "For every new city that we take, we have made it known that the first soldier to scale over the walls of an enemy city will receive a gold coin, paid from the state treasury. Now, all are clamoring for this honor, fighting like they are possessed by infernal spirits! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil15!"
 crete_mission_inv_6_task:0 "Squeezing Every Last Drop"
 crete_mission_inv_6_task_DESC:0 "Our wars of conquest have been devastating on our communities, this is known, but our present circumstances have forced us to draw even deeper from this well, squeezing every available drop of manpower from our villages and cities. We shall never forget this priceless gift given to us by our mothers and sisters, and promise to fight for the dream of Crete! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil9!"
 crete_mission_inv_7_task:0 "A Rationing System"
 crete_mission_inv_7_task_DESC:0 "Not only do we need to import grains to feed our soldiers, but we must also regrettably introduce a system of rationing in our provinces - in these times, every head of grain, every pinch of flour must be accounted for. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil2!"
 crete_mission_inv_8_task:0 "Conquering the Unconquerable"
 crete_mission_inv_8_task_DESC:0 "Some have claimed that Crete was a land filled with impregnable cities, all populated by thieves, liars and pirates. As our recent successes have demonstrated, the first portion of this adage is clearly untrue. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil15!"
 thicc_crete_tt:0 "Own five provinces on the island of Crete."
 crete_mission_inv_9_task:0 "The Bull Jumpers"
 crete_mission_inv_9_task_DESC:0 "Our scouts have finished exploring the province of [GetProvince('(int32)358').GetName] and claim that we must pay a visit to the ancient ruins ourselves. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil3!"
 crete_mission_inv_10_task:0 "As It Was, So Shall It Be Again"
 crete_mission_inv_10_task_DESC:0 "In times of old, Crete was under the dominion of one power, and we are thankful to announce to the world that these days have returned. The fractious period that gave rise to our ascendance, one frought with danger and misery for the people of Crete, has finally come to an end.\n\nAs the powerful Minoans once ruled from [GetProvince('(int32)358').GetName], we shall emulate their example and follow in their footsteps. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil10!"

 me_crete_1_desc:0 "[SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] bursts out of the tent, a filthy stream of curses erupting from [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] mouth, and moments later is joined by [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] entire entourage. All that are standing outside - not an insignificant number, as a large number of soldiers have been milling about all morning - can thus see for themselves how the negotiations are going. A quiet murmuring ripples through the gathering crowd as [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] turns to address them, face flushed with rage.\n\n'A few weeks ago, I, [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], sent word to the Tribal Elders, seeking an audience to discuss the danger the Carthaginians pose to us all, and yet no one had to decency to answer the call save the Tibulatians, who are foreigners on this island as much as the North Africans are. I expected our cousins to answer the sacred call, considering that we have many Crete tribes on this island, but I shouldn't be surprised that they all slink away from a war council.' Turning towards a red-faced [GetCountry('X47').GetRuler.GetName], who is standing with arms crossed, [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] extends [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] finger and continues [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] tirade, [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] voice trembling in anger.\n\n'I believe that you are all cowards, unworthy to sleep with pigs! [GetCountry('X47').GetRuler.GetFirstName], you dare to come here with honeyed words promising a false peace, your breath sweetened by Carthaginian wine and your pockets flush with their silver - enough! You are no partner in war, but a serpent in the grass. Leave at once, lest I break my oath of hospitality and strike you down where you stand!' The mood in the throng turns ugly as [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] screams 'There shall be no mercy shown to anyone! Sardinia will be ours!'"
 me_crete_inv_1.a:0 "Death to cowards and foreigners! We shall slay them all!"
 me_crete_1_tooltip:0 "#R Our diplomatic relations with Taulantia are sure to suffer in the aftermath of this outburst#!.\nBecause none are willing to join us, we have gained claims over the entirety of Sardinia - the mission task '#Y Gathering the Tribal Elders#!' has now been #G Completed#!!""

 me_crete_2_desc:0 "[SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has arrived at the farming settlement that was just recently completed, deciding to leave nothing to chance and desiring to personally inspect the handiwork of our workers. [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] walked through the fields, inspecting the quality of the soil, and spent hours walking through the storerooms, checking the provender for the farm animals and whether or not their stalls were properly cleaned - no detail was deemed too insignificant for [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] attention. After an incredibly long day, everyone was relieved when [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] made his pronouncement."
 me_crete_inv.2.a:0 "We can prepare for what is to come, knowing our bellies will be full"

 me_crete_3_title:0 ""
 me_crete_3_desc:0 "For months now, we have had men working hard in the mountains, quarrying the necessary stone to repair the nuraghe fortifications in our lands. The work is grueling, and the laborers often complain mightily during the heat of the day, but all are aware that this difficult work is of utmost importance.\n\nAlthough we have full faith in the ability of our soldiers to protect our people, our minds are at ease, knowing that, if all else fails, we can gather within the walls of the nuraghe to regain our strength."
 me_crete_inv.3.a:0 "May we never have the need to retreat to these towers"

 me_crete_4_desc:0 "From [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] vantage point in the nearby hills, [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has a commanding view of the plains below, with all eyes on the thick trail of black smoke drifting upward from [GetProvince('(int32)3504').GetName]. For months, the Carthaginians have known of our preparations, but in their hubris, dismissed us as mere barbarians, incapable of executing our war plans. They thought themselves safe behind their walls, but they clearly misunderstood the nature of the danger they were in.\n\nTurning to a nearby advisor, [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] drily gives an order. 'Find the commander of the citadel and send his head to Carthage. Spare no one else that you find.'"
 me_crete_inv.4.a:0 "This is a message that the Carthaginians will understand..."

 me_crete_5_desc:0 "We have finally received news that our ongoing construction at [GetProvince('(int32)3506').GetName] is almost finished, despite the harrassment of the local Tibulatians and Corsians who do not wish to see our presence in the region. Still, the soldiers at the worksite are more than capable of driving off these skirmishers, so work draws to its inevitable conclusion.\n\nAlthough the fortress at Viniolae is an impressive achievement, our chief architect has informed us that we could do more to bolster our defenses, if we have the coin to do so."
 me_crete_inv.5.a:0 "This is more than suitable for our purposes"
 me_crete_inv.5.b:0 "It's worth spending more, to prevent a calamity in the future"

 me_crete_6_title:0 "A Foothold in Phikaria"
 me_crete_6_desc:0 "Although we have done our best to secure the northern coasts of Sardinia, we find ourselves constantly bothered by Corsian and Tibulatian raiders, who, unable to accept their defeat at our hands, have resorted to brigandry, taking by cunning and treachery what they cannot by force of arms. Erroneously believing themselves safe on the island of Corsica, we have been forced to build an outpost on the island, with hopes to harry their attempted crossing of the Mare Sardoum at the source.\n\nThe situation is fine for now, but untenable long term...we may be forced to pacify the island eventually."
 me_crete_inv.6.a:0 "Now we can keep an eye on this damned rabble"

 me_crete_7_desc:0 "'Get down, you fool! They are almost upon us!' [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] hisses, grabbing [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] Warchief by the tunic and pulling them towards the brush. Seconds later, a large raiding party of light cavalry gallops past the location where you were just standing - disaster was barely avoided. Giving the signal once the drumbeat of hooves has faded, [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] gathers [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] soldiers and they crawl on their stomachs up the hill, watching the enemy horsemen as they head towards the coast.\n\nThe Carthaginians have doubled their patrols lately, and although they are flooding our island with silver, hiring anyone and everyone willing to stand against us, our scouts are finding the hidden places in the mountains and valleys and keeping an eye on their movements, gods be praised. With a bit of luck, we will be able to keep this advantage."
 me_crete_inv.7.a:0 "Do your best to remain unseen - we need the element of surprise"

 me_crete_8_title:0 ""
 me_crete_8_desc:0 "Desperate times call for desperate measures, as the saying goes, and although our people have not sacrificed humans to the gods in many years, [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has decided that we must appeal to the gods of war and death. The air is filled with the heart-rending wailing of women and children as our soldiers drag them from the wagons and push towards the execution site. Some, casting a pitiful glance at [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] on their way to the chopping block in hopes of finding compassion, find their gaze unmet. There will be no clemency today, only the axe.\n\nOf course, our reputation at home and abroad will suffer because of this...the Carthaginians will tell everyone that we are barbarians, and point to this moment as evidence of our savagery. "

 me_crete_9_desc:0 "For a long time, we have known that the settlement of [GetProvince('(int32)3494').GetName] has been an important waystation for Carthaginian merchants, who oftentimes stop at this friendly port for fresh water and supplies while traversing the pirate-haunted Mare Sardoum.\n\nNeedless to say, our recent victory there shall do much to frustrate these efforts. Oh, yes, and the treasury left behind is a nice addition to our own coffers."

For as long as anyone can remember, the Carthaginians have terrorized our island from behind Sulki's walls, acting as if they owned the island, but now the gods have abandoned the perifidious men from North Africa, and the hour of judgment is at hand.\n\nWhen [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName]'s armies first encircled Sulki, it was known that victory would result in the hated Carthaginian capital being utterly destroyed. By razing this city, the crimes of their fathers will finally be avenged, and their hateful presence shall be purged from the land forevermore.\n\nWe hope that the Carthiginians will be able to see the smoke of Sulki's destruction from their homes..."
