gadir_inv.27.desc:0 "With Carthage being on our doorstep, we should find a partner that would help us against our nemesis - even if we pretend to submit for now. Because now, we are alone, and a lone wolf is easy prey. \nWe can either ask #Y [SCOPE.sCountry('alliance_target_1')GetName]#! or #Y [SCOPE.sCountry('alliance_target_2')GetName]#! for an alliance. It is important however that they respect us, otherwise they will just laugh at our faces..."
